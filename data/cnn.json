Over the past 11 days, a rebel alliance charged through Syria in the boldest challenge to the Assad rule in years – following decades of brutal reign by the Assad dynasty marked by fighting, bloodshed and an oppressive political crackdown. “This is a momentous moment, not just for the Syrian people, but for the people of the Middle East, Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians or otherwise,” Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Middle East Institute, on Sunday. “This is a regime that, for over 50 years, under the mantra of freedom, unity and socialism, oppressed, tortured and disappeared many millions in Syria.” Now, as the anti-regime coalition starts to disband Assad’s military, and lays out for a post-Assad Syria, experts wonder if the next phase will be a new dawn for a people strangled by a brutal autocracy – or whether sectarianism will bring a different type of authoritarian rule. Syria’s armed opposition ultimately plans to form a government defined by institutions and a “council chosen by the people,” Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the militant figure driving the latest rebel swing, told CNN. He heads the dominant group in the coalition, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), a former Al Qaeda affiliate. Jolani declared victory for the “entire Islamic nation” on Sunday, in his first public remarks since the rebel-led coup, which he said “marks a new chapter in the history of the region.” “Syria is being purified by the grace of God Almighty and through the efforts of the heroic Mujahideen,” Jolani told a crowd at the majestic Umayyad Mosque, in Damascus. He denounced “Iranian ambitions” in Syria, where Tehran and its proxy Hezbollah were core backers of Assad’s government. “My heart longed for this moment,” added Jolani. “There is not a single household in Syria that the war has not touched.” Before armed fighters set off a stunning offensive , Assad’s chokehold had split Syrian territory among regime and rebel forces – some of which are backed by international powers, including the US and Turkey. What emerged on November 27 was the “Militant Operations Command,” a spectrum of militias welded together by one shared cause – to liberate government-held areas and depose the president. Jolani had told CNN that if opposition forces succeed in ousting Assad, they will form “a state of governance, institutions and so on.” Soon after the fall of Damascus to southern rebels, Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi Al-Jalali pledged with the rebels and endorse “a smooth and systematic transition of government functions” and preserve “state facilities,” in a recorded message. Jolani echoed a similar memo, saying that all public institutions would remain under the prime minister’s jurisdiction “until they are officially handed over.” Syrian rebels that senior regime officials were preparing to defect to them in Damascus. But delegating a new governing system will be “extremely challenging” for a “diverse coalition” of armed fighters, according to Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group. “Some groups are more structured, more organized, including (HTS) and some of its allies,” he told CNN , whereas others are “more local entities.” As the rebels pressed on, so did Jolani’s charm offensive. The militant leader, who emerged as a young fighter for al-Qaeda against the US in Iraq, has sought to diminish the shadow of his extremist roots. The United States designated HTS a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on Jolani. Millions of Syrians, including those from minority Christian and other religious communities, are haunted by a legacy of persecution suffered at the hands of extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS. Human rights advocates have accused HTS and other anti-regime groups of cracking down on residents in areas under – including in the northwestern Idlib, western Homs, and Aleppo governorates – and tortured and abused dissidents. Jolani told CNN that abuse in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and HTS had already penalized the perpetrators. “Anti-government armed groups have promised restraint and to uphold humanitarian norms, but they will ultimately be judged by their conduct not their words,” Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on December 4. In a state TV address on Sunday, a Syrian rebel commander insisted that “all sects” would be protected, adding: “Syria is for everyone, without exception … Syria is for the Sunni, the Druze, the Alawite.” Maksad, the senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, warned the fall of the Assad regime could be a “moment of potential peril” for minority communities in the country, including religious groups like Alawites, Ismailis, Druze and Christians. “There are concerns about the more Islamist jihadi elements of this rebel force,” he said, particularly when it comes to Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the main group driving the country’s armed opposition, which has been designated a terrorist group by the US and many other countries,” said Maksad. But on the streets of Syria, such concerns were eclipsed by scenes of excitement and mass celebration. Thousands of people assembled at the foot of the main square in Damascus, where rebels ransacked Assad’s residence. “After the fear that he (Assad) and his father made us live in for many years, and the panic and state of terror that I was living in, I can’t believe it,” Omar Daher, a 29-year-old lawyer, told the Associated Press. Another Damascus resident, Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, said: “From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.” And further afield, Syrian refugees forced to flee the war shared their hopes of returning to a peaceful country. “We thank our people in Syria and the free ones, for saving us from the injustice,” Wissam Ahmed, a displaced Syrian in Lebanon, told Reuters on Sunday. “We’re going to Syria, God willing, to rebuild our future and our homes. The feeling is really great, we cannot describe it more.” CNN’s Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi, Raja Razek, Mostafa Salem, Lucas Lilieholm, Becky Anderson, Catherine Nicholls and Lauren Kent contributed reporting. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker,” Trump was asked if he would try to replace Powell. “No, I don’t think so. I don’t see it,” Trump said. “I think if I told him to, he would. But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t. But if I told him to, he would.” Welker followed by asking Trump if he had plans to ask Powell to resign. Trump responded, “No, I don’t.” The comments mark the first time since the presidential election that Trump has publicly backed Powell. In July, Trump said he Powell if he won the election and in November, a senior adviser to Trump that Trump would likely allow Powell would finish his term as chairman. Trump, however, has threatened to remove Powell from his post on several occasions after the central bank raised interest rates in 2018 and even called Powell “the enemy” in 2019. In March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman” and that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion,” after markets tanked amid the pandemic. But he also praised Powell for cutting rates to zero to prevent an economic collapse. Trump nominated Powell to serve as head of the US central bank in November 2017. Powell was later reappointed by President Joe Biden to serve another term. Barely 48 hours passed after Trump’s election before a reporter asked Powell if he’d resign if Trump asked him to. Powell responded that he would not. “Not permitted under the law,” Powell repeated twice. There are legal barriers for Trump, and any other president, to remove or fire a Fed chair. It requires what America’s central bank refers to as “for cause.” Ultimately, the Supreme Court could have the final say on what merits a “for cause” firing of a Fed chair. But while that fight, which would probably be lengthy, plays out, Powell would likely still get to stay in his job until his term ends. Trump had accused Powell of being “political,” and said that the Fed has considered rate cuts “for the sake of maybe getting people elected” in a February interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. Trump has also said that his threats to remove Powell were because interest rates were too high, but the Fed chair went too far by cutting rates “too much.” Trump has also shared another plan if he can’t fire Powell: getting the central bank to consult him on interest rate decisions. “I feel the president should have at least a say in there. I feel that strongly,” Trump said at a about the Fed’s interest rate decisions. “I made a lot of money. I was very successful. And I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve — or the chairman.” The Fed is intended to be an independent governing body free from political influence so that it doesn’t make decisions that could upset the scale of job creation and low inflation. It’s unclear whether Trump would need to take away the Fed’s independence. Either way, Powell is against the idea, and told reporters in September that independent central banks typically have lower inflation. “It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public, and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue,” he said.

Late Thursday, the Orange County jury ordered that the manufacturer Funtime pay $155 million each to Tyre Sampson’s parents, Nekia Dodd and Yarnell Sampson. He died on March 24, 2022, after falling 70 feet from Icon Park’s Orlando Free Fall ride. The trial lasted only a day as Funtime never appeared in court to defend itself. Icon Park had already settled with for an undisclosed amount. “The jury’s decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre’s death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits,” the family’s lawyers, Ben Crump and Natalie Jackson, said in a statement. “The ride’s manufacturers neglected their duty to protect passengers, and (Thursday’s) outcome ensures they face the consequences.” The family will now have to seek an order from an Austrian court to collect the damages. Funtime did not immediately respond to an email sent to its headquarters Friday seeking comment. The company’s website shows that it manufactures thrill rides that throw, drop and spin passengers at high speeds and from tall elevations, including attractions named Vomatron, Sling Shot and Chaos Pendle. Sampson, a football standout who stood 6 foot, 2 inches tall and weighed 380 pounds, was visiting Orlando on spring break from the St. Louis, Missouri, area when he went with friends to the downtown amusement park. They rode the Orlando Free Fall, which placed 30 riders in seats attached to a tower, secured them with a shoulder harness and then dropped them 430 feet. It didn’t have seat belts, something most drop rides have as an additional safety measure. Because of Sampson’s size, the harness didn’t lock properly and he was ejected from his seat when the ride braked 70 feet from the ground. His parents argued that Icon and Funtime should have warned their son of someone his size going on the ride and didn’t provide an appropriate restraint system. Adding seat belts would have cost $660. The state ordered the ride closed after the accident and it never reopened. It has . © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Another man told CNN he had a bone fractured at the top of his spine. Some, trying to document the violence, said they had their cameras smashed or stolen, before being beaten themselves. A week of fierce demonstrations in has seen special forces violently handling protesters who are challenging the government’s controversial to delay its bid to join the European Union. The former Soviet republic has known protests before, but many say these are larger and more vicious. Many Georgians feel they are on the cusp of returning to the from which they escaped a generation ago and say they will protest for as long as it takes, despite the ruthless response. Watchdogs say that many of the scores of people arrested over the past week have been subjected to brutal treatment by police and special forces. CNN spoke to 10 protesters, including five journalists and an opposition politician, who said they were beaten by special forces – masked, unidentifiable men. They suffered injuries, they said, ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones that left some hospitalized. CNN has asked the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs for comment on the alleged brutality by the masked forces but has not received a response. Tensions were simmering in the country since a disputed in October. The ruling Georgian Dream party – already 12 years in office – claimed victory, but observers say the vote was neither free nor fair. The European Parliament has called for a re-run. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on November 28 his government would suspend accession talks with the EU, which some 80% of Georgians support joining. His Georgian Dream party had even made joining the bloc a constitutional commitment. Within hours, thousands descended on the parliament in the capital, Tbilisi, to demand the government honor its promises. Aleksandre Keshelashvili, a journalist for local outlet Publika.ge, told CNN he arrived at the protest in the early evening. He watched as Salome Zourabichvili – the country’s pro-Western president, in a standoff with her own government – confronted a wall of police, knocking on their riot shields and asking: “Who do you serve, Georgia or Russia?” Later, the police were bolstered by dozens of masked men. Although they have been present at protests before, their numbers were far greater this week, demonstrators said. Unlike ordinary police officers, these men do not wear uniforms showing their department and rank. “They don’t have any identifiable signs,” Keshelashvili said. Some of them confronted Keshelashvili as he stood by the parliament with other journalists. Suddenly, he said, they pulled him away from the group and began to beat him. “I was shouting, ‘I’m a journalist,’” Keshelashvili said, adding that he tried to explain he was just doing his job. Next, he was thrown into what he described as a “beating corridor”: Around a dozen men punched him, then kicked him when he fell to the floor. He said he lost consciousness. When he awoke, both of his cameras had been stolen. “We are not a very big media outlet. We don’t have much money to buy these things,” he said. After being taken into custody, Keshelashvili said he would have spent a night in a cell, if a doctor had not seen him and said he needed urgent surgery. His nose had been broken in several places. Down the street, more violence was unfolding. Guram Rogava, a presenter with Formula TV, was broadcasting live outside the parliament, reporting on the police response as it ramped up around him. After finishing his shot, Rogava began to move towards a sidewalk. When his back was turned, a masked man was seen running behind him and striking the back of his head. Rogava collapsed. “I don’t remember anything,” he told CNN. Only by watching a video of the incident did he learn what had happened to him. Rogava was seen with blood streaming down his face as his colleagues tried to help him. He later learned he had fractured a cervical vertebra in his neck. His doctor said if the bone moves much more, “I could lose control of my hands and legs.” Zourabichvili said journalists have been deliberately targeted. Multiple reporters told CNN they faced the worst violence on the first two nights, and that government forces have since backed down slightly. To some, this suggested orders from above. Aka Zarkua, a journalist at RealPolitika, said the fact that reporters were largely left alone on Sunday night suggested “when they were beating journalists, it was a clear edict from the police riot chief. It was politically motivated.” Some have said journalists may have been targeted to prevent evidence of police brutality being documented. Mariam Nikuradze, a reporter at OC Media, said the special forces get “angry” when they see their actions being filmed. But even if evidence is collected, she said it counts for little in Georgia’s legal system. “Over the past few years, I’ve been to so many trials. The courts are so biased that no matter what kind of evidence you present there, they just make political decisions,” Nikuradze told CNN. Before trial, conditions in custody are grim. The Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, a watchdog, said most individuals arrested on Monday had been “brutally beaten… both during and after their arrest.” Erekle Loladze, a winemaker, said he was beaten while being driven in a police van into custody. Before, he had been swarmed by dozens of masked men in a back alley near the parliament. “They kicked me all over my body, and at one point, someone stood on me with both feet and jumped,” Loladze told CNN in writing. His jaw was broken in two places, leaving him unable to speak. Once in court, cases are seemingly rushed through. Shota Murtskhvaladze, who works in education, said his case was heard overnight Sunday. He asked to postpone the trial, so he could collect video footage from shops near where he was assaulted by special forces, sustaining a minor injury to his face. His request was denied. He was only allowed to bring one witness, despite several of his friends seeing the attack. He said he was fined 3,000 lari (about $1,000) for not complying with a police order to disperse. Critics are troubled by the government’s growing reliance on these special forces to try to stem protests. “They have no numbers of identification, which is contrary to any international rule,” Zourabichvili told CNN. Elene Khoshtaria, one of the leaders of the opposition Coalition for Change party, told CNN these forces comprise “specially trained, huge men who look more like wrestlers than policemen.” Shortly before he was assaulted, Rogava had interviewed Khoshtaria on live television. Khoshtaria herself was later attacked multiple times by special forces. She said they “clearly” knew who she was, telling her, “Elene, go away, stop, f**k you” as they grabbed her by the hair and led her away. In a later clash, she fell to the ground, fracturing her hand. On Wednesday, opposition co-leader Nika Gvaramia after he was beaten unconscious by officers in the capital Tbilisi, his party said. Gvaramia represents the Droa party, the party that Khoshtaria founded. Although the use of special forces is troubling, Khoshtaria said it is a sign of the regime’s weakness. Unlike fully-fledged autocratic states like Belarus, she said Georgian Dream does not have enough police willing to mete out violence against civilians so they rely on a few hundred masked men instead. With the protests now raging every night for a week, Khoshtaria said the opposition movement is in a battle of endurance with the government and its agents. “They are exhausted,” she said of the government. “They thought that there would be a small crowd of people in front of the parliament. What they got is the whole of Tbilisi coming out – and also in the regions.” Although some of the protesters are too injured to rejoin the movement, many said the violence they have faced will not deter them. Giorgi Gamgebeli, a freelance photographer, said he sprained his ankle in a clash with police, which also left him unconscious. Will he be returning to protest? “Of course,” he told CNN, waving his crutches in the air. CNN’s Caitlin Danaher contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

On October 19, Georgia upset the then-top-ranked Longhorns 30-15 in Austin. “When we received the request for Bevo to be on the sideline in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, our staff looked at several alternatives including the sideline location,” SEC spokesman Chuck Dunlap said. “The reality is there is limited sideline space at the stadium. We can’t jeopardize the safety of Bevo or the game participants. With the narrow sidelines, location of multiple sets for television and camera carts, there is not enough space. While we want to honor tradition across the conference, the space limitation is a reality.” Dunlap also said the conference did identify several options for Bevo, including a location at SEC FanFare, but there was no opportunity for him to be on the field due to the space limitations.

Seven other children are currently hospitalized and “under control,” according to the State of Mexico’s secretary of health, Macarena Montoya. Health authorities have since issued a nationwide epidemiological alert and ordered the suspension of the use and administration of intravenous solutions from the medical device company Productos Hospitalarios. CNN has reached out to Productos Hospitalarios for comment. On its website, the company – which hasn’t made any public statements related to the outbreak - says it has “36 years of experience in the development of innovative solutions for health care.” Mexico’s President called the situation “very sad” on Friday and said her government’s objective is to “care for the families” and determine the cause of the deaths. Klebsiella oxytoca is a bacteria notorious for hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, soft tissue infection and a type of blood poisoning which often leads to septic shock. According to the CDC, in hospital settings, “patients with devices like ventilators (breathing machines) or intravenous (vein) catheters, and patients taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

Provided it is ratified, the accord would create one of the world’s largest free trade zones, covering a market of 780 million people that represents nearly a quarter of global gross domestic product. The accord’s proponents in Brussels say it would save businesses some $4.26 billion in duties each year, slashing red tape and removing tariffs on products like Italian wine, Argentine steak, Brazilian oranges and German Volkswagens. Its critics in France, the Netherlands and other countries with big dairy and beef industries say the pact would subject local farmers to unfair competition and . From Uruguay, the host of the Mercosur summit, hailed the deal as a “truly historic milestone” at a time when global protectionism is on the rise. “I know that strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, toward isolation and fragmentation, but this agreement is our clear response,” von der Leyen said, an apparent reference to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s vows to protect American workers and goods. Under pressure from his country’s powerful and vocal farming lobby, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday the deal remained “unacceptable” as it stands and stressed that governments have not yet seen “the final outcome” of negotiations. “The agreement has neither been signed nor ratified. This is not the end of the story,” Macron’s office said, adding that France demands additional safeguards for farmers and commitments to sustainable development and health controls. For France to block the deal, it would need the support of three or more other EU member states representing at least 35% of the bloc’s population. The French government, which has been rallying countries to oppose the pact, named Austria, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland as other wary states that share French concerns about the deal. To take effect, the pact must also be endorsed by the European Parliament. In remarks aimed at her “fellow Europeans,” and perhaps in particular French skeptics, von der Leyen promised the accord would boost 60,000 businesses through , streamlined customs procedures and preferential access to raw materials otherwise supplied by China. “This will create huge business opportunities,” von der Leyen said. She then turned to address European farmers who fear that an influx of cheap food imports will jeopardize their livelihoods.

Outrage over environmental rules, rising costs and unregulated imports over the past year. Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who long have pushed for the deal praised the announcement Friday, welcoming the results as a boon for export industries. It marks the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which is comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and, newly, Bolivia. The bloc had previously only managed to conclude free-trade deals with Egypt, Israel and Singapore. “An important obstacle to the agreement has been overcome,” said Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, where the nation’s vaunted car industry is poised to profit. From Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called the agreement “an unprecedented economic bridge.” At the Mercosur summit in Uruguay’s capital of Montevideo, praised “a modern and balanced text which recognizes Mercosur’s environmental credentials.” “We are securing new markets for our exports and strengthening investment flows,” he said. The Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency said it expects the pact to boost the nation’s Europe-bound exports by $7 billion.

The Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases: one from family members who sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the other from the Biden administration, which is siding with those families. At issue are a series of deadly attacks inside Israel that date to the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. The case is not directly related to – but will take place in the shadow of – the . In one of the cases now before the justices, a federal court in 2015 awarded victims more than $650 million under the federal Anti-Terrorism Act, which permits Americans to sue for damages caused by terrorism. But the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that verdict, ruling that courts lacked jurisdiction over the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. The Supreme Court declined to review that decision in 2018, but Congress then enacted a law in 2019 that allowed the plaintiffs to haul the Palestinian groups into court. As the litigation continued, lower courts ruled that the new law violated the equal protection clause. The Biden administration intervened to defend the law, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court in August. The plaintiffs described the 2nd Circuit decision as “more than dangerous” and “flat wrong.” The Palestinian Authority told the Supreme Court in a briefing that because it does not “maintain any constitutionally meaningful connection to the United States,” allowing federal courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims “for alleged attacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due process.” The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the spring and hand down a decision before July. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The agency announced the expanded testing of the milk supply in a new federal order issued on Friday. Infectious disease experts have called for expanded testing since the beginning of the outbreak, arguing that the virus can’t be contained until farms, vets and federal regulators know where it is spreading. Dairy farmers had initially resisted calls for more widespread testing, fearing a loss of income if their herds were quarantined. “Among many outcomes, this will give farmers and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus’ spread nationwide,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a The new order requires the sharing of raw milk samples, upon request, from dairy farms, bulk milk shippers, milk transfer stations or dairy processing facilities that send or hold milk for pasteurization. It also requires that herd owners with cattle that test positive for bird flu provide information that enables contact tracing and disease surveillance. Lastly, it requires labs and vets that have positive test results for H5N1 to report them to the USDA. The USDA said it will immediately begin testing milk in storage silos at dairy processing facilities across the country for the H5N1 virus. Based on those results, the agency will work with states to do bulk tank testing at farms, and If the milk is positive, officials say they will work quickly to identify “specific cases” and establish enhanced biosecurity measures. Once all the herds in the states are cleared, the USDA will continue to monitor milk in bulk tanks to make sure the infection doesn’t re-emerge. The first round of testing is scheduled to begin the week of December 16, though some states have already started testing that complies with these requirements, the USDA noted. Six states will be included in the first round of testing: California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania. While California, Colorado and Michigan are known to have had infected herds, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania have not reported any problems. The milk testing in those states will help authorities better understand whether bird flu is a threat in areas where the illness has so far gone undetected. The USDA first announced the new National Milk Testing Strategy in October. Friday’s order is the first time it has released the specific details of its plans. The milk is being tested before pasteurization, a process that heats milk to a specific temperature over time and kills harmful bacteria and viruses. “Even if the virus is detected in raw milk, the current pasteurization process … will inactivate the virus,” the US Food and Drug Administration . Almost all the milk sold in the United States is pasteurized. Health officials have long warned against drinking raw milk or feeding it to animals. Raw milk is not pasteurized and can can carry disease-causing pathogens such as listeria, campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli and bird flu virus. In California, Raw Farm milk and cream was recalled and product distribution was after bird flu virus was detected recently in samples from store shelves, dairy storage and bottling sites. No illnesses have been linked to the milk. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Now Jessica Tisch’s NYPD hunts for the killer of a CEO", "description": "A week after taking over the nation’s largest police department, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch found herself reassuring New Yorkers that investigators would “not rest until we identify and apprehend the shooter” who brazenly gunned down the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare outside a Manhattan hotel.", "language": "en", "datePublished": "2024-12-06T09:00:42.608Z", "dateModified": "2024-12-06T21:45:46.145000+00:00", "content": "A week after taking over the nation’s largest police department, Jessica Tisch found herself on Wednesday reassuring New Yorkers that investigators would “not rest until we identify and apprehend the shooter” who brazenly gunned down the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare outside a Manhattan hotel. The high-profile, high-tech manhunt for the masked shooter who killed the head of one of the country’s largest health insurers is the first major hurdle for a new NYPD commissioner long familiar with department culture and a strong proponent of surveillance technology in crime fighting. “I want the department to go to the next level – more than just catching bad guys – but how do we use the technology,” Mayor Eric Adams said during a CNN appearance with Tisch the week before she was sworn in on November 25. “She’s planted the seed for some of the technology we’re looking at now.” Among the first clues in the frantic hunt for the assailant who killed were numerous videos and images – from city streets and from a Starbucks store. The masked shooter was for Thompson outside the New York Hilton Midtown Wednesday morning, according to Tisch. When Thompson approached the building, a dark-hooded figure with a gray backpack appeared and shot him in the back, shows. Thompson stumbled forward before turning to face the assailant and falling. The gunman calmly walked toward the CEO and continued to shoot, video shows. Thompson was pronounced dead less than half an hour after the incident. “It’s never the kind of attention that you want on New York City,” Kenneth Corey, a former NYPD chief of department who worked with Tisch in the intelligence bureau, told CNN of her handling of the CEO shooting investigation so early in her tenure as the department’s 48th commissioner. “So her challenge is really managing that.” Investigators told CNN the assailant crossed the street from the hotel, fled through an alleyway, and got on an electric bike before heading north toward Central Park, where he was last seen on video at 6:48 a.m. Video from a Starbucks near the hotel showed the assailant buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, a senior police official said. Tisch, a 12-year NYPD veteran, led the development and implementation of the Domain Awareness System, which the city described in as “the heart of the NYPD’s crime fighting and counterterrorism operations.” The , which brings together information from license plate readers, tens of thousands of closed-circuit television cameras, facial recognition tools and phone call locations to identify people, has been . “This case is going to get made on technology, as so many are today, and she knows probably better than anybody what technology the NYPD has available to it because she brought most of it into the department in the first place,” Corey said. “And remember that not all of that technology belongs to the NYPD or belongs to government,” Corey added. “It’s really being able to leverage that technology and to piece it all together.” Indeed, investigators tasked with tracing the assailant’s steps have been combing through a mountain of surveillance video, and examining evidence he may have left behind throughout the city and at the scene of the shooting. The search includes thousands of and surveillance cameras. Police are also developing clues from believed to have been dropped by the suspect when he fled the shooting scene. The phone could yield fingerprints, DNA and –– if technicians can unlock it –– other clues to the suspect’s identity, investigators said. As of Thursday, police were still trying to access the phone, a law enforcement official said. “So you’re going to stitch together, for starters, a video timeline that starts with the shooting and shows this person fleeing,” Corey said. “But they’re also going to rewind that and track him.” During her 12 years at the NYPD, including a stint as deputy commissioner of information and technology – and 17 years overall in city government – Tisch has embraced a high-tech approach to law enforcement. She also oversaw NYPD 911 operations. “She spearheaded efforts to use technology to transform the NYPD’s fundamental business processes, including how officers are dispatched and respond to 911 calls, take crime reports, investigate, and search for wanted or missing persons,” the city said in announcing her appointment. The mayor’s office credited Tisch with providing every member of the force with a smartphone for access to real-time information in the field. She joined the NYPD – as a civilian – as a counterterrorism analyst in 2008 and headed the implementation of the NYPD’s body-worn camera program, according to the city. She graduated from Harvard College, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. “I think we have revolutionized law-enforcement technology. We have given officers access to data where and when they need it: in the field and in real time,” Tisch told the That high-tech sleuthing has come into play this week as detectives use video and other investigative tools to piece together of the shooter’s movements. Surveillance video appears to show the suspect leaving the subway at 57th Street before the shooting. A massive search of Central Park occurred after detectives reviewed video of the man believed to be the suspect leaving the park on West 77th Street and no longer wearing a backpack. And an extensive video canvass led police to a hostel on the Upper West Side, a police official told CNN. The NYPD released photos of a smiling man standing at the front desk of the hostel. Police said he is “wanted for questioning.” It’s unclear when the photos were taken. Investigators also have video of the suspect on the Upper West Side carrying what appears to be an electric bicycle battery, the sources said. Former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton – who coauthored an , a publication of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank – praised Tisch’s “impressive and unconventional resume” as well as her “legal savvy and business acumen.” “One question she seems especially well-suited to answer is how the NYPD can leverage new force-multiplier technologies—including AI, facial recognition, drones, and risk-assessment tools—to do more with less, given the recent struggles with recruitment and retention,” the City Journal article said. Tisch also served as commissioner of the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and, most recently, as head of the Sanitation Department. is CEO of the Loews Corp. Tisch told the Harvard Business Review that she “very randomly” decided to join the NYPD in 2008 after graduating from law school. She thought it would be difficult finding a job during the financial crisis. “I can’t even imagine what someone like me would do at the Police Department,” she recalled saying when a friend suggested she work for the NYPD. She is the second female commissioner at the nation’s oldest police department. On CNN last month, Tisch described herself as “a person who takes challenges head-on.” “She’s not an outsider and I think that’s important,” Corey said. “And, you know, the old adage is, the only thing that cops hate more than change is the way things are right now. When she sees where change needs to be made, where efficiencies can be gained, she’s not going to be deterred.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Democratic National Committee appeared flush with cash, despite recent post-election staff cuts, and a leading liberal super PAC appeared to have tens of millions of dollars in unpaid bills. Vice President Kamala Harris’ defunct campaign, meanwhile, had just $1.8 million remaining in its bank accounts after spending more than $1 billion in a failed effort to defeat Republican Donald Trump. The Harris campaign reported no debts. But the filings with the Federal Election Commission overnight – which cover fundraising and spending between October 17 and November 25 – offer just a snapshot of the financial outlook for a party working to regroup after losing the White House and the Senate and failing to flip the House last month. Aides to key committees say they are still dealing with outstanding invoices and other accounting issues as they close the books on the costly presidential contest. A full view of Democrats’ finances might not be apparent until January when candidates, parties and outside groups file their year-end reports with the FEC. The filings show Harris burned through money during the final, intense home stretch of the campaign, plowing more than $270 million into the effort to win the presidency from October 17 through the post-election period. That frenzied spending in the final weeks of the campaign and Democrats’ aggressive efforts to secure donations after the election and raised alarms that her campaign was grappling with unpaid bills. But after record-breaking fundraising, Harris’ campaign reported $1.82 million in cash on hand as of November 25. In the weeks since the election, Democrats have continued to bombard supporters with fundraising appeals, seeking more contributions. A fundraising email sent this week, for instance, from Harris’ joint fundraising committee with national and state Democratic parties, sought donations to a “Harris Fight Fund” program, which it said is aimed at electing “Democrats down the ticket ready to hold Trump accountable.” The fine print shows the proceeds going first to the Democratic National Committee in an effort to shore up the national party’s finances. In its filing Thursday with the FEC, the DNC reported more than $47 million remaining in the bank and no debts – despite recently shedding . That’s in sharp contrast to the main super PAC that backed Harris’ candidacy for the White House, which ended the post-election period with nearly $50 million in unpaid bills, the FEC reports show. The group, Future Forward, listed $47.3 million in debts as of November 25, largely related to advertising expenses. Chauncey McLean, who oversees Future Forward, said those bills do not amount to “real debt,” but reflect a requirement by the FEC that the group report an estimate of its spending on advertising on a rolling, real-time basis. “The invoices are already paid,” and the next report the group files will reflect those payments, he said. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Elizabeth Pollard, 64, was found dead Friday in the mine in the southwestern Pennsylvania community of Marguerite shortly after 11:00 a.m., Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Trooper Steve Limani said. Crews still were working to recover her body early Friday afternoon, he said. Pollard’s family has been notified, Limani said. “The family … kept telling us, ‘We really want to have the body back so we can lay her to rest,” Limani said. “As a group, we just really wanted to make sure that we were able to do that.” Pollard’s body was found “not far away from where we believe that she’d been when she fell through the sinkhole,” Limani said. “It was just a matter of the work to remove all the dirt.” At a news conference Friday afternoon, local officials said they had to use heavy machinery to extricate Pollard’s body from the mine after it began to collapse. The discovery ends a dayslong search that started early Tuesday when, , a relative told authorities that Pollard and her 5-year-old granddaughter had left in a car to look for her cat Monday afternoon and since. Police who were looking for the woman then discovered her vehicle early Tuesday – with her granddaughter unharmed inside after being there nearly 12 hours – parked near a restaurant. A fresh, deep sinkhole was just steps away. That spurred a rescue mission, part of which involved workers pumping water through a long-abandoned mine at the site to clear out debris, then removing it with a vacuum to make it easier to see what was underground. But by Wednesday evening, state police they no longer expected to find her alive, saying cameras and sound detection equipment failed to pick up signs of life, and that the compromised conditions of the mine made it for rescuers to continue with the techniques they’d been using. The sinkhole where Pollard was believed to have fallen is in an area with limestone bedrock and had almost no ground left, state police said. The sinkhole likely appeared at some point Monday, officials said. Two abandoned mines are near the sinkhole, a shows. They are designated as posing “highest danger to citizens’ lives” due to land safety and environmental concerns, according to the National Association of Abandoned Mine Land Programs. Mike O’Barto, chair of the Unity Township board of supervisors, said his tight-knit community, which includes Marguerite, is grieving. “We’re made of several old coal mining towns,” he said. “And when people suffer, we all suffer. My hope is that a tragedy like this never happens again.” Trooper Limani described the mine complex where Pollard was discovered as “almost like a mini town underneath this town.” He said engineers from the state department of mining will soon begin the long process of backfilling and shoring up the mine to try to prevent another accident. ﻿Sinkholes usually form due to groundwater slowly eroding the underground rock that holds soil together, and Pennsylvania is particularly prone to sinkhole damage because of its limestone bedrock, . © 2024 Cable News Network.

Israeli troops also forced health care workers and patients to leave the facility, and destroyed critical medical supplies, according to a statement by Dr Hussam Abu Saifya, the hospital director. In the early hours of Friday, the Israeli military sent two plain clothed messengers into the hospital, who told people over a megaphone to evacuate, Abu Saifya added. The military detained a “large number” of young men in the two-hour raid, including health workers and Palestinians who had sought refuge, added Abu Saifya. Israeli quadcopters unleashed a blaze of “intense and direct fire” as military vehicles encircled the facility, Abu Saifya recalled, before corralling patients, displaced people and health workers in the courtyard and forcibly taking them to a checkpoint further south, towards Gaza City. “Initially, there was a series of airstrikes on the northern and western sides of the hospital, accompanied by intense and direct fire,” Abu Saifya said in a statement on Friday. “They approached me and ordered me to evacuate all patients, displaced persons, and medical staff, gathering everyone in the hospital’s courtyard and forcibly taking them to the checkpoint. “In the morning, we were shocked to see hundreds of bodies and wounded individuals in the streets surrounding the hospital,” the doctor added. “The situation is catastrophic in northern Gaza, particularly in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital.” Members of an Indonesian medical delegation – the only team performing surgery at Kamal Adwan – were among those forced to leave and not allowed to return, according to Abu Saifya. Hours later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from one of the last remaining functioning facilities in northern Gaza. Hospital staffers and patients left the facility to find hundreds of bodies and wounded people lining surrounding streets, Abu Saifya added. A photo posted by Abu Saifya on social media showed at least 17 shrouded bodies laying on the hospital courtyard. Another 20 people were left injured and “in need of urgent care,” he said. The Israeli military severely damaged oxygen generators overnight, Abu Saifya told CNN, saying there are now just two “inexperienced” surgeons available to administer life-saving care at the hospital. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied striking or operating within Kamal Adwan Hospital in a statement to CNN, instead saying that its forces fought “against terror infrastructure and terrorists” in the nearby Jabalya area. “IDF troops continue to operate against terror infrastructure and terrorists in the Jabaliya area, including adjacent to the Kamal Adwan Hospital,” it said. “Simultaneously, in recent weeks, coordinated efforts with international organizations have been underway in order to transfer patients, companions, and medical staff to other hospitals which are operating in the Gaza Strip.” The statement added that the IDF is in “continuous contact” with Kamal Adwan to deliver supplies and equipment. According to COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, 161 aid trucks entered Gaza on December 4. There was no official evacuation order ahead of the raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital, according to a “People started to climb the wall to escape, and this panic attracted IDF fire,” the UN health’s agency representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Rik Peeperkorn, said on Friday. Human rights agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of subjecting residents in parts of northern Gaza to relocation . Since October, 2023, 58% of 273 missions led by the UN’s World Health Organization were denied, canceled or impeded, the agency said on Friday. The attack on Friday was the second such raid by the Israeli military since forces sprung an incursion on three cities in northern Gaza on October 5, razing entire streets, spawning severe hunger and leaving emergency crews unable to rescue people wounded by the onslaught. The Israeli military has said the assault is targeting Hamas’ renewed presence there. More than 3,700 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s Government Media Office (GMO). Another 10,000 people have been injured, the GMO said on Monday. At least 30 people were killed by Israeli bombing on houses around Kamal Adwan overnight, according to Dr Munir Al Bursh, the director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN footage from Kamal Adwan Hospital on Friday shows a huge orange blaze lighting a pile of rubble in the courtyard. Inside the facility, medical workers nursed injured Palestinians, including young children. Many of those moaned from the pain of open wounds, while others lay motionless on the floor. In another clip filmed outside the hospital, dozens of men could be seen looking around helplessly, and trying to lift wounded people heaped under thick layers of debris. On Thursday, an Israeli drone struck and killed a 16-year-old boy in a separate attack as he was entering the hospital’s X-ray department in a wheelchair, Abu Saifya told CNN. The teenager, Mahmoud Abu Al-Eish had been wheeled to the facility by his sister, who is a nurse at the hospital, Abu Saifya said. Another man in his thirties was also killed. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on Abu Saifya’s allegations. At least 1,050 health workers have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, according to the Ministry of Health in Ramallah. The Israeli military launched a renewed incursion on three cities in northern Gaza on October 5, saying it is targeting Hamas’ renewed presence in the area. “Kamal Adwan Hospital is now being subjected to a new war crime, and the occupation forces are practicing all forms of killing and violence in it and around it,” the health ministry in Ramallah said on Friday. “The remaining wounded inside it are suffering from severe wounds and are in immediate need of treatment. “For more than a year, the ministry has been appealing on a daily basis to provide protection for treatment centers, health cadres, ambulance crews and vehicles and volunteer medical teams, to stop the aggression, and to allow the entry of urgent medical supplies and the exit of the wounded for treatment.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

Local health authorities say there could also be hundreds of dead and wounded, but because the situation is highly fluid, those numbers have not been confirmed. OCHA warned that “as hostilities in northern Syria escalate and expand to other parts of the country, civilians – including humanitarian workers – are facing grave threats to their safety. The fighting also continues to cause severe damage to critical infrastructure and disrupt aid operations.” As rebels took over the northwestern cities of Aleppo and Hama over the last nine days, “tens of thousands of people have arrived in north-east Syria,” OCHA said. Humanitarian centers are rapidly approaching full capacity, and some people are sleeping on streets or in their cars in sub-zero temperatures. The UN is working with its partners in the northeast to help thousands of families arriving at reception centers. Israel has instructed its forces “to maintain a high level of preparedness and to continuously monitor the developments” in Syria, the country’s defense ministry said in a statement Friday. The instruction comes after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Herzi Halevi, the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), “held a security situation assessment following the developments in Syria.” The Israeli military “is prepared for any scenario and is determined to protect the citizens of Israel and protect Israel’s security interests at all times,” the statement said. Earlier on Friday, the Israeli military said it launched airstrikes on positions inside Syria that it said were used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons, a rare instance of Israel acknowledging attacks on its war-torn neighbor. The IDF said air strikes were conducted on “weapon-smuggling routes and terror infrastructure sites” near Syria’s border with Lebanon in an effort to “thwart weapon-smuggling operations from Syria into Lebanon” used by the Iranian-backed militant group. The advance of opposition forces in Syria poses “a serious danger” to the Iran, Iraq and Syria itself, the foreign ministers of the three countries said in a joint statement on Friday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam al-Sabbagh held a trilateral meeting in Baghdad on Friday to discuss the crisis in Syria as rebels continue advancing. The three countries described the Syrian armed opposition forces as “terrorists,” stressing that there was “a need for collective action to confront it.” The ministers also condemned “the ongoing Israeli attacks on Syria as well as on Gaza and Lebanon,” the joint statement said. “There is no choice but to coordinate, cooperate and continue diplomatic consultation to eliminate all risks of escalation in the region,” they added. They also emphasized “the need to mobilize all Arab, regional and international efforts in order to reach peaceful solutions to the challenges facing the region in general and Syria in particular.” With anti-regime offensives gathering pace both to the north and south of the capital Damascus, Kurdish-led fighters say they have moved into eastern parts of Syria. Kurdish forces occupy the northeast of the country, having achieved hard-won autonomy during a decade of civil war. They fear that autonomy could now be under threat by Syrian opposition insurgents who launched their offensive last week. Although the target of that offensive is the Assad regime, a statement by Kurdish fighters shows they fear the violence could spill over into their territory. “The developments taking place in our homeland, Syria, pose a threat to the security of our people and our Deir Ezzor region. In particular, Turkish occupation-backed mercenary groups and ISIS mercenaries are reactive in the Deir Ezzor desert,” the Deir Ezzor Military Council said Friday. In response, it said it had deployed fighters in Deir Ezzor city and west of the Euphrates River. “Our primary objective is to protect our security and the security of our people,” it said. The Syrian defense ministry has not yet commented on the latest development in the eastern part of the country. Rebels have taken control of a Syria-Jordan border crossing, as the fighters consolidate their gains in southern Syria after launching a fresh offensive earlier Friday. In a video geolocated by CNN, armed fighters were seen marching down a road by the Nassib border crossing, after wrestling it from government control. The Nassib border crossing marks the southernmost point of the major M5 highway, which runs from the northern city of Aleppo and through the capital Damascus. After capturing Aleppo a week ago, the rebel fighters pushed south along the highway and on Thursday took the city of Hama. They have now set their sights on Homs. On Friday Jordan’s Interior Minister Mazen Al-Faraya announced that its Jaber border crossing, which is opposite Syria’s Nassib crossing, was closed due to the security situation in southern Syria. The anti-regime rebels in the north will be bolstered by the new offensive in the south. Earlier Friday, southern rebels captured a string of border posts further west in Daraa province. The Assad regime may not be able to withstand the rebel offensive unless Russia provides swift and significant military support, according to Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a UK-based think-tank. “It is highly doubtful that the regime can survive without a rapid large-scale Russian deployment. As HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) and other forces bear down on Damascus, the prospect of that happening is starting to look very slim,” Quilliam told CNN. “The regime may put up more of a fight in Damascus than it has done in Aleppo and Hama, but the momentum is currently with HTS and other fighting groups - all of whom are highly motivated and intent on sweeping Assad from power,” he said. Although Russia has launched airstrikes on the rebel stronghold of Idlib and, once it fell into rebel control, the city of Aleppo, Quilliam said Russia has so far shown “minimal” support for the embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “It is surprising that Russia’s intervention so far has been minimal, given the scale of its earlier deployment in 2015 when the Asad regime last looked as though it were about to be swept away,” he said. Because the Russian military is “overstretched in its war in Ukraine,” Quilliam said it appears Moscow “does not have the capacity to come to the Assad regime’s rescue this time around.” On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow “will decide on military aid depending on how the situation evolves” in Syria. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Syria’s anti-regime forces to “march” on without “hardship,” as he vouched for the rebel coalition smashing through government-held areas on Friday. “I will say that our wish is that this march in Syria continue without any accidents or hardship,” he told a gaggle of reporters in Istanbul. “If you remember, we called on Assad. We said, ‘Come on and let’s talk about Syria and its future together.’ Unfortunately, we did not get a positive answer from him.” The Turkish government has been a key stakeholder in the years-long civil war in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad’s brazen grip on power has split swathes of territory among regime and rebel forces – some of which are backed by international powers. Turkey under Erdogan has supported rebel groups and has deployed Turkish forces to retain command over the rebel-held strongholds of northern Syria. Earlier this year, Erdogan publicly sought a meeting , the man he once called a terrorist, to steady relations and ultimately help resolve a domestic refugee crisis borne from millions of Syrian people fleeing the regime. But those efforts failed, with the opposition Syrian National Army – essentially a proxy group for Turkey – exercising a key role in the rebel takeover of Aleppo last week. Turkey had initially tried to stop the anti-regime offensive, to “prevent further escalation” in regional wars in Lebanon and Gaza, a Turkish security source told CNN. Fighters from Syria’s Druze religious minority have joined the fight against the Assad regime in the south of the country, a local activist group told CNN. Druze are fighting in the southern city of as-Suwayda, which neighbors the Daraa province, where rebels launched a fresh anti-government rebellion earlier Friday. Two local Druze groups – the Men of Dignity Movement and Mountain Brigade Gathering – have joined the fight along with several other factions, according to Suwayda 24, an activist group. “They are announcing the declaration of a general mobilization in the province following the rapid developments,” it said in a statement. The involvement of Druze fighters could bolster the brewing offensive in southern Syria. Earlier, rebels in Daraa launched an uprising, saying “our destination is Damascus.” The Druze community has historically been anti-Assad, but the Syrian regime has consistently tried to keep as-Suwayda city isolated from major military movements. The population is spread across Syria, Lebanon and Israel, with families often divided across these three nationalities. Ahmed Al Sharaa, an Islamist militant in his late 20s, to Syria from Iraq in 2011 with six men and a monthly stipend of $50,000 from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who would go on to become the world’s most wanted terrorist. His mission was to establish Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, Jabhat Al Nusra. Sharaa is now commanding thousands of men in an armed rebellion threatening to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He’s better known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. in the Saudi capital Riyadh to Syrian parents from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and raised in Damascus, Jolani said in an interview with PBS in 2021 that he was galvanized by the Second Palestinian Intifada (uprising) against Israel in the early 2000s and went on to become a jihadist in Iraq after the 2003 US invasion. His deep knowledge of Syria caught the attention of his commanders in Iraq as they were looking to expand their foothold in Syria during the country’s uprising. Over the years, his influence grew despite his identity being kept under wraps. During , he never faced the camera directly and always covered his face in public appearances. His public debut was in a when he announced a split from Al Qaeda to create what he said was a Syria-focused anti-regime front with other local factions, called Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (the Front for the Conquest of the Levant), which later changed to Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), or the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant. Rebels in the south of Syria said they have taken control of a major government military base in Daraa province, just hours after launching the fresh offensive Friday. Video geolocated by CNN showed rebel fighters exchanging fire with regime forces near al-Hirak, a town near Brigade 52, the second-largest government military base in the province. In a statement, the Southern Operations Room – a newly formed group representing the southern rebels – said its fighters “have successfully liberated Brigade 52 in eastern Daraa after battles with regime forces stationed there.” Brigade 52 was accused of being involved in the shelling of civilians in the city of Daraa between 2012 and 2015, when Syria’s civil war was most intense. The new group of rebels in the far south of Syria have said their goal is to reach Damascus. In a statement shared with CNN, the Southern Operations Room – a newly formed group representing the southern rebels – called on government forces to defect “from the Assad regime’s criminal gang” and join the rebels. “Our destination is Damascus, and our meeting point is the public square of Umayyads,” the group said. The group said it had captured a cluster of government posts along the Jordan-Syria border. “Our forces are now securing the border strip following the surrender of the regime forces stationed there,” it added. The southern Syrian rebel movement began in 2012, when local activists formed Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups in Daraa. The fighters initially took control of Daraa city, but the regime was later able to reclaim it. Although there have long been frequent low-level clashes between the southern rebels and regime forces, Friday’s uprising marks the first major flare-up in years. So far, regime forces have only been fighting on one front. The main rebel offensive began in the northwest Idlib province, but has since pushed Bashar al-Assad’s troops further south down the long road to Damascus. Now, the Assad regime faces the prospect of a fight on two fronts, with the main offensive to the north and the fresh one gathering momentum in the south. A new uprising is underway in the southern Syrian province of Daraa, far away from the main rebel offensive speeding towards Homs in the north. In a statement, the newly formed group said their goal is to “work collectively to build a new Syria.” Videos geolocated by CNN showed rebel fighters capturing a road near the border with Jordan, south of Daraa city. By Friday afternoon, videos showed dozens of men on motorbikes heading north. In another video, a “Free Syria” flag was seen raised in the town of Dael, north of Daraa city on one of the highways to Damascus. The southern Syrian rebel movement began in 2012, when local activists formed Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups in Daraa. The fighters initially took control of Daraa city, but the regime was later able to reclaim it. Although there have long been frequent low-level clashes between the southern rebels and regime forces, Friday’s uprising marks the first major flare-up in years. The red, black, white and green colors of the Free Syrian Army flag flecked the streets of Aleppo on Thursday, after Syrian rebel forces seized control of the northern city to set off a lightning offensive against President Bashar al-Assad’s dynastic regime. CNN footage from Aleppo showed scenes of hope, joy and apprehension among residents, some of whom had returned following years of displacement from the city – the site of some of the worst destruction by regime and allied Russian forces in more than a decade of civil war. “We had a lot of dreams about getting back to Aleppo, but we didn’t actually believe that this moment is going to be true,” Mohammed Ali Joudeh, a displaced resident, told CNN’s Jomana Karadsheh on Thursday. “All the people here are worried about what’s going to happen, because the airstrikes always attacked us,” he added. “We hope [our country] is going to be clear from the Assad regime. All of Syria, not just Aleppo.” Thick layers of rubble from destroyed buildings could be seen in the CNN video, in images reminiscent of the first few years of – when the Assad regime laid siege to rebel-held parts of the city in a brutal fight known as the . Then, human rights groups the regime of launching chemical attacks and indiscriminate shelling on civilians. Both Syrian and Russian authorities have denied the allegations. Syria’s rebels have captured at least two towns on the road from Hama to Homs. The Military Operations Command, the newly formed coalition that launched its offensive last week, said it had “established control over the cities of Talbiseh and Al-Rastan in northern Homs countryside.” Videos geolocated by CNN showed the rebel fighters had entered Rastan and Talbiseh, both located on the main M5 highway from Hama to Homs. Talbiseh is just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Homs. In a video, fighters are seen driving by a roundabout in Talbiseh, leaning out of the vehicles and firing their guns into the air in celebration. The Russian Embassy in Syria has urged Russian nationals to leave the country, as the rebel offensive continues to wrest territory from government control. In a brief statement, the embassy in Damascus appealed to Russian citizens to “leave the country on commercial flights” due to “the difficult military and political situation in Syria.” Moscow is a key backer of Syria’s government in Damascus and has for years helped to prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has attempted to stall the rebel offensive by launching airstrikes in the northwest region of Idlib and the city of Aleppo, which rebels captured last week. A disparate group of rebel forces comprise the – a new coalition which may be trying to capitalize on a weakened regime whose key allies are caught up in other regional wars. The coalition, which is made up of extremist factions and other fighters backed by key players, is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that used to go by the name Al-Nusra Front. HTS officially cut ties with al Qaeda, and has been the de facto ruler in the city of Idlib, in northwestern Syria. The Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army is part of the rebel coalition that took control of most of Aleppo city, in northern Syria. The group also claimed to have captured the villages of Shaaleh and Nairabiyyeh in Aleppo’s northern countryside. There are numerous stakeholders in this multi-front civil war, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – a group largely made up of Kurdish fighters from the Peoples’ Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey has designated a terrorist organization. The SDF has fought other Syrian opposition groups, but has in the past received support from the US for its fight against ISIS. The militant leader of the core group driving Syria’s armed opposition that his main goal is to “overthrow” autocratic leader Bashar al-Assad, just as rebel forces move apace to take control of yet another major city from the regime . “When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,” Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the chief of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), said on Thursday. “The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it… the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: This regime is dead.” Al-Jolani spoke to CNN on the heels of a stunning offensive launched by anti-government militias more than a week ago, when rebels wrenched control of the country’s second-largest city Aleppo – before capturing the strategic city , further south. Then on Friday, streams of civilians have been seen fleeing Homs, ahead of potential hostilities between regime forces, and rebel forces who charged towards the city. Syria’s rebel fighters have a shared goal of crunching Assad’s dynastic grip on power. But Jolani’s roots in al Qaeda – which he later broke ties with – have cast a shadow over his ambitions. Human rights advocates also raised concerns over HTS’ recent treatment of political dissidents in Idlib, in northwestern Syria. The United States designated HTS a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on Jolani. Hundreds of people appear to have fled the central city of Homs overnight into Friday, as anti-regime rebels push further south on the road to the capital Damascus. Videos from overnight into Friday showed hundreds of vehicles lining the highway out of Homs, as the city braces for potential clashes between the rebels and the regime. Homs has a sizeable population of Alawites, co-religionists of Assad, many of whom fear retribution from Islamist militants who accuse Alawites of dominating the country and supporting Assad’s quashing of the rebellion. Events are moving incredibly quickly in Syria. A third government-controlled city could soon fall to rebel forces after just over a week of fighting. After capturing Aleppo last week, Syria’s rebel fighters pushed further south and on Thursday swept into the city of Hama, dealing another crushing blow to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The next stop on the major highway towards the capital Damascus is the crossroads city of Homs. “Our heroic people in Homs, your time has come,” a spokesperson for the rebels said on Thursday. As of Friday afternoon, the rebels have captured more towns along the road and are now just a handful of miles from Homs. If captured, this would split the territory under the control of Assad into two areas: one along the coast and the other in Damascus. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

In a news conference, the family also expressed deep frustration with the Biden administration for telling them in a meeting Friday that it is waiting to see how the rapidly unfolding events in Syria resolve before being able to do more to try to free Tice. “He is being cared for, and he is well,” said Austin’s mother Debra Tice at a news conference at the National Press Club, citing what she called a “significant source that has already been vetted all over our government.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not comment on the source referred to by the Tice family. “I don’t have anything to share about conversation on this particular matter,” said Jean-Pierre at a press briefing at the White House. A source familiar with what the Biden administration knows says there is no change in the administration’s assessment of Austin Tice, and they have no new information. Bill McCarren, director of the Press Freedom Center at the National Press Club, emphatically insisted the Biden administration is “lying” about what they know about Tice. In August, the State Department marked 12 years since Tice was taken, saying: “We know the Syrian government has held Austin, and we have repeatedly offered to find a way to bring him home.” Members of the Biden administration in the past have said they believe Tice is alive but have not been definitive in an assessment. The Syrian government has not acknowledged that they are holding Tice nor offered any proof of life. Despite no longer having diplomatic relations, in the past few years, the US government has engaged with Syrian officials on the issue of Tice, including a visit to Damascus by the State Department’s top official for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens. Tice’s case is complicated by the rapid advances made by Syrian rebel forces across the country over the past two weeks, taking key cities and potentially endangering dictator Bashar Assad’s regime. The changing dynamics in Syria could both open up new opportunities for Tice’s potential release or complicate it. Austin’s brother, Jacob Tice, said that he asked White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan for a commitment that the US would talk directly to Assad about freeing Austin, but that Sullivan would not give the family such a commitment. “I found that to be a striking response, given what we have heard from the president himself about the ceaseless efforts he has encouraged his administration to take in order to free Austin,” Jacob Tice said. A National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement that Sullivan did meet with the family, adding that “Sullivan has regularly met with the families of wrongfully detained Americans, and the Biden-Harris Administration continues to work to bring these Americans home to their families.” Debra Tice slammed the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leading the latest rebel offensive, calling them “terrorists” who are “tearing up Aleppo.” “When I think about war, I never have a happy moment. I don’t really understand what’s happening in Syria,” said Debra Tice, who later acknowledged that “it’s possible this could (mean) Austin’s release.” Austin’s sister, Meagan Tice, said that she was told the Biden administration is “waiting to see how all of these pieces play out over the next week before we can do anything definitive,” referring to the recent rebel offensive. “Our larger question was, how can we use this disruption to leverage something for Austin during this time?” she said. “And unfortunately they didn’t have much answer to that at all.” The now-43-year-old Tice traveled as a freelance journalist to Syria in the summer of 2012 to report on the war there. He was detained at a checkpoint near Damascus on August 14, 2012, just three days after his 31st birthday. Austin’s father, Marc Tice, said that the family met with the State Department on Thursday, but that the meeting was not productive. “There were complaints and finger-pointing about who is preventing things from happening and who’s responsible for doing what,” Marc Tice said. Debra Tice also praised President-elect Donald Trump for his interest in her son’s case during his first term, calling it an “obsession” of Trump’s. “When Donald Trump was elected, that was the first thing on my mind, was to remind him of how much he loved Austin and how much he wanted (him) home,” she said. Austin’s younger sister, Naomi Tice, became emotional recounting “how different our lives are from what I think we had kind of planned and hoped and dreamed for” since Austin was imprisoned. “He went there with this passion and conviction and I would love to see that our government has the same passion and conviction to bring him home,” she said.

In the lengthy affidavit, people who knew Craig, 46, described his purported descent: A risk taker with a dental practice that was struggling financially and a tumultuous marriage. Over more than 50 pages, an Aurora Police Department homicide detective laid out evidence – including witness statements, text messages and computer search histories – revealing what the department’s investigations division chief called The affidavit of probable cause said, “James has shown the planning and intent to end his wife’s life by searching for ways to kill someone undetected, providing her poisons that align with her hospitalized symptoms, and working on starting a new life” with another woman. Craig has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges in the death of his wife, Angela Craig, who was 43. On what was to be the first week of Craig’s trial, prosecutors and police accused him of plotting murders from behind bars, including that of an Aurora detective who investigated the case. Craig faces two additional felony charges including solicitation to commit first-degree murder, according to a court filing by prosecutors with the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office. The defendant attempted to convince a fellow inmate to carry out the alleged plot, according to police and the amended complaint. The document does not disclose the intended targets, but Aurora police confirmed to CNN one of them is a detective who investigated the case. Neither the complaint nor the police department identified the detective. The 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office has declined to provide more information. The new charges were filed November 22, one day after Craig’s defense attorney, Harvey Steinberg, withdrew from the case. Court records show Craig has not yet retained a new attorney. His trial is on hold until he gets new legal representation. The judge in the case approved the request of Craig’s former attorney to leave after a closed-door hearing last month. CNN has reached out to Steinberg for comment. In his request, Steinberg cited two rules of professional conduct, . The first states, “the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer’s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent,” and the second that “the client insists upon taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement.” Jury selection was supposed to begin the day Craig’s attorney withdrew. Craig’s next hearing is scheduled for December 16. On March 15, 2023, Angela Craig complained of a severe headache and dizziness, and was later declared medically brain dead at a hospital, Aurora police . The arrest warrant affidavit it was Angela Craig’s third visit to the hospital that month. “Hospital medical personnel could not find a known medical condition that would have caused Angela’s rapid medical decline,” the affidavit said. During a March 15, 2023, hospital visit, Craig sent a text message to Michelle Redfearn, the wife of his business partner, Ryan Redfearn, describing Angela’s condition as grave, according to the affidavit. The couple are friends. James Craig had been texting Michelle Redfearn regularly since Angela’s hospital visit on March 9. She’s a professor with a doctorate in nursing and asked him to keep her updated, the affidavit said. Angela Craig had reported feeling dizzy and weak but doctors could not determine the cause. In the texts, James Craig included detailed information about the medical tests his wife received. He texted two photos of hospital personnel working on his wife in a crowded room. “If it wasn’t my wife, this would be kind of a fun puzzle to try to work out!” he wrote at one point. Another text from Craig read: “It’s weird not being able to wake her up.” Michelle Redfearn told CNN on Friday that the couple declined to comment because they expect to testify at trial. Her husband, who is also a dentist, told investigators he was business partners with Craig since August 2022, the affidavit said. He acquired Craig’s practice, which was “struggling financially.” The two men attended dental school together and had known each other for more than two decades. Ryan Redfearn described Craig as a “risk taker” who was “on the verge of bankruptcy again” after filing for bankruptcy in 2021, according to the affidavit. On the day of Angela’s final emergency room visit, Ryan and Michelle Redfearn went to the hospital, where he told a nurse that he suspected his business partner’s wife had been poisoned, the affidavit said. Ryan Redfearn told the nurse James Craig had recently ordered potassium cyanide at their office when “there was no medical reason or purpose” for the lethal substance at the practice, according to the affidavit. Michelle Redfearn told investigators about a call Craig made to her husband after the couple’s hospital visit, according to the affidavit. She overheard the conversation on the car’s speakerphone: Craig said he heard “some disturbing information” and asked if Ryan had said anything to the hospital personnel, the affidavit said. Ryan Redfearn told Craig he had told the hospital staff about the package delivered to their office. Craig initially said the package contained a ring for Angela but ultimately admitted what was in it. An office manager had opened the parcel and reported its contents to Redfearn, according to the document. Craig told Redfearn that Angela had asked him to order the substance but “he didn’t think she (Angela) would actually take it.” Redfearn told Craig “to stop talking and get a lawyer,” according to the affidavit. In a text message to Redfearn, the affidavit said, Craig made an “urgent plea” asking his friend to not speak with law enforcement. “You are under no obligation to answer their questions … and you will do more damage than good to my family by continuing to insert yourself into this,” Craig wrote, according to a screenshot of the text in the affidavit. In the lengthy message, Craig accused Redfearn of unleashing a “horrible storm” on his family and pleaded that “if there was ever any love in your heart for me, please don’t make this any worse by talking to any officers,” the affidavit said. Craig concluded: “Also, please do not respond to this text message until I text you again,” according to the document. Investigators also uncovered text messages between Craig and his wife on the morning of March 6, 2023, when she first began to feel ill, according to the affidavit. “I feel drugged,” she wrote, according to a screenshot in the affidavit. “Given our history, I know that must be triggering,” he wrote back, the affidavit said. “Just for the record, I didn’t drug you.” In the weeks before her death, James Craig used a computer at his dental practice to research multiple “undetectable poisons” and make internet searches including “how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human” and YouTube searches for “how to make poison” and “Top 5 Undetectable Poisons That Show No Signs of Foul Play,” according to the affidavit. Angela Craig’s sister told investigators the couple’s marriage was tumultuous and she was told by Angela that James Craig had previously drugged her because he was planning to attempt suicide and didn’t want his wife to be able to stop him, according to the affidavit. The affidavit said Craig told the Department of Human Services that his wife had been suicidal and “had told fellow employees that his marriage was failing, and he was in financial turmoil.” The document said none of the people interviewed by investigators suggested Angela Craig had expressed suicidal thoughts. After Angela Craig was declared medically brain dead on March 15, her sister told investigators James Craig told her he did not want an autopsy to take place. “James said he felt if they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her when she was alive he wouldn’t let them poke her more when she was dead,” according to the affidavit. The Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office found that Angela Craig ingested lethal doses of cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, listing arsenic poisoning as a “significant condition” related to her death, , citing the autopsy report. She died on March 18, 2023. The affidavit said Craig at the time had been “communicating with a woman … about what appears to be a sexually intimate relationship.” The document said Craig bought the woman a ticket for a flight to Denver “while his wife and the mother of his children was dying in the hospital.” CNN’s Andy Rose, Rebekah Reiss, Raja Razek, Elizabeth Wolfe and Hanna Park contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.” Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance representing Connecticut, New York and Missouri had previously said that, starting in February, it would deny any claims for anesthesia services that exceeded specific time limits set for surgeries and procedures. Anthem had said the change was part of an effort to make health care more affordable by reducing overbilling for anesthesia. After about the proposed plan, one major professional group of anesthesiologists said on Friday it was “pleased that Anthem has reversed course on its deeply flawed policy proposal to no longer pay for anesthesia care if the surgery or procedure goes beyond an arbitrary, Anthem-set time limit, regardless of how long the surgical procedure actually takes.” “Anesthesiologists provide individualized care to every patient, carefully assessing the patient’s health prior to the surgery, looking at existing diseases and medical conditions to determine the resources and medical expertise needed, attending to the patient during the entire procedure, resolving unexpected complications that may arise and/or extend the duration of the surgery, and working to ensure that the patient is comfortable during recovery,” the American Society of Anesthesiologists said in . The company had previously said the standards it would use to determine how long a surgery should last were consistent with industry standards and formulas set by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Maternity-related care and pediatric services for patients younger than 22 were to be excluded from the change. Anesthesiologists said Anthem’s policy would have added a significant amount of undue strain to providers and patients and reflects a great misunderstanding of how things work in the operating room. Dr. Gordon Morewood, vice chair for the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Committee on Economics, recently participated in a meeting between the society and Anthem executives. He said that experts tried to explain the way anesthesia billing works — that one specific billing code could be used for nearly 200 different procedures, leaving great variability in the amount of time needed under anesthesia — and learned that Anthem hadn’t audited claims and didn’t have any evidence that there was a problem that needed to be fixed. “It’s a cynical exercise in figuring out a way to reject more claims initially, knowing that a number of those are just going to fall off and never be paid,” Morewood said. It would be extremely difficult for anesthesiologists to bill for unnecessary time, especially in operating room settings where many detailed time stamps are recorded and with the help of automated electronic health records, experts say. Any additional time under anesthesia is usually related to ensuring that patients are safely cared for, such as securing a safe airway, or responding to physiologic changes that may occur because of the surgery, such as blood pressure or respiratory changes, said Dr. Rick van Pelt, a board-certified anesthesiologist and chief clinical transformation officer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. “This approach (by Anthem) reflects a profound lack of understanding of the role of the anesthesiologist in providing safe, high-quality care to patients as an integral member of the surgical care team,” he said. “While no anesthesiologist would intentionally compromise on the care they provide, it is inevitable that unwarranted time pressure will increase the risk of adverse medical events and patient harm.” Anesthesiology is often a top fear for surgical patients and adding uncertainty around insurance coverage threatens trust in a vulnerable moment, said Morewood, who is also chair and professor of clinical anesthesiology at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine. Reassuring patients about insurance concerns can take away from time spent explaining the risks and benefits of the actual medical care. “Oftentimes you’re meeting your anesthesiologist on the day of surgery. And yet, this is someone in whom you are literally putting your life in their hands. They are responsible for your continued existence on this planet an hour, two hours, six hours from now. So that’s a very charged environment,” he said. “To have insurance companies saying, ‘Okay, the meter is going to run out after an hour and a half’ is just unconscionable.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

In one stark example, a Facebook post by UnitedHealth Group expressing sadness about UnitedHealthcare CEO ’s death received 62,000 reactions – 57,000 of them laughing emojis. UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, the division that Thompson ran. New York police have yet to determine the , but in an interview with NBC, Thompson’s widow, Paulette, told the network that “there had been some threats” against her husband, potentially related to “a lack of coverage… I don’t know the details.” A source told CNN that there were against UnitedHealth Group, although Thompson’s name was not mentioned. A shell casing recovered from two of the bullets at the scene of the shooting had the words “depose” and “delay” written on them, according to law enforcement sources. Police are exploring whether the words indicate a motive since they are similar to the title of a book that’s critical of the broader insurance industry – “Delay Deny Defend.” The majority of insured US adults including denial of claims, with their health insurance in the span of a year, according to a survey released in June 2023 by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. “Limitations on access to care due to claims denials have absolutely been a source of frustration for a long time,” said Kaye Pestaina, KFF’s director of Program on Patient and Consumer Protections. A major industry group for health insurers criticized some of the social media reactions. “The people in our industry are mission-driven professionals working to make coverage and care as affordable as possible and to help people navigate the complex medical system,” Mike Tuffin, CEO of the trade association, AHIP, said in a statement. “We condemn any suggestion that threats against our colleagues – or anyone else in our country – are ever acceptable.” UnitedHealthcare said in a statement to CNN that its main priorities are to support Thompson’s family, ensure the safety of its employees and work with law enforcement to bring the gunman to justice. “We, at UnitedHealth Group, will continue to be there for those who depend upon us for their health care,” the statement said. Other insurers did not return requests for comment. Almost immediately after news broke that Thompson had been killed, social media users began posting about their frustrations with UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies. UnitedHealthcare “denied my surgery two days before it was scheduled. I was in the hospital finance office in tears (when I was supposed to be at the hospital doing pre-op stuff),” one user wrote in an X post that received more than 70,000 likes. “My mother was flying out to see me. My surgeon spent a day and a half pleading my case to United when she probably should have been taking care of her other patients,” she added, before saying the surgery ended up going ahead but calling the process “torture.” “My breast cancer surgery was denied” by a different insurance company, another X user posted. “Breast cancer. She asked me ‘well, is it an emergency?’ I don’t know- it’s (f***ing) cancer. What do you think? I had to appeal and luckily it went through. Evil to do that to people,” she said. Their stories could not be independently verified by CNN. TikTokker and anesthesiologist Brian Schmutzler said in a video that the shooting was “obviously tragic for him, tragic for his family, but this brought up some bigger issues.” “From my perspective, we have a bigger issue with the insurance companies in general, who, essentially, it’s their job to make money, not to actually pay for health care,” he said. In a Thursday entitled “Why ‘we’ want insurance executives dead,” journalist Taylor Lorenz, who covers social media, analyzed the online responses: “No, that does not mean people should murder them. But if you’ve watched a loved one suffer and die from insurance denial, it’s normal to wish the people responsible would suffer the same fate.” Lorenz’s post sparked a wave of backlash online. It’s not uncommon for Americans and their doctors to go through multiple hoops to get approval for the care doctors say their patients need, or to combat denials from carriers – even though 81% of insured adults in KFF’s 2023 survey rated their health insurance as “excellent” or “good.” “This is care that people’s doctors recommend for them, and some of this care can be frightening,” Sara Collins, senior scholar at The Commonwealth Fund, a health policy foundation, told CNN, giving a cancer diagnosis as an example. “To get any kind of denial or delay while your insurer figures out whether or not they’re going to cover it is frightening for people. To have a decision all of a sudden be being made on the basis of financing is terribly upsetting for families.” Nearly one in five insured adults experienced claim denials during a 12-month period, according to . Those with job-based insurance or Affordable Care Act policies ran into this problem about twice as often as those covered by Medicare or Medicaid, whose denial rates were around one in 10. Restricting access to health care through tools like claim denials and prior authorization, which requires that insurers approve the care in advance, are among the ways that health insurers try to weed out care that’s not medically necessary or not backed by scientific evidence – but it can also increase their profit margins. The practices, which increasingly rely on technology, including artificial intelligence, can infuriate patients and providers alike. A class action lawsuit filed last year in US District Court in Minnesota argued that UnitedHealthcare uses AI “in place of real medical professionals to wrongfully deny elderly patients care,” according to the . More than 90% of the denials are reversed through an internal appeal or proceedings before federal administrative law judges, the suit alleges. UnitedHealthcare asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming the plaintiffs must first exhaust the administrative appeal process set by the Medicare Act, among other reasons. The denial of claims can lead to major problems for patients, both in terms of care and their finances. Last year, UnitedHealthcare settled a case brought by a severely ill college student in Pennsylvania who claimed the company denied coverage for drugs determined necessary by his doctors, leaving him with a medical bill of more than $800,000. The lawsuit, which was chronicled by , uncovered the lengths to which the insurer goes to reject claims, including burying medical reports and relying on rubberstamped recommendations from doctors paid by the company. Roughly a quarter of consumers whose claims insurance companies denied experienced significant delays in getting medical care or treatment, and about the same share were unable to receive care, the KFF survey found. About a quarter of those said their health declined. Having to postpone care because of coverage denials can also affect patients’ mental health. Some 80% of adults said they or a family member were worried or anxious about delays in care, according to a 2023 Commonwealth Fund survey of adults ages 19 to 64. Relatively few people try to fight when their insurer turns down their claim. Only 43% of adults in the Commonwealth Fund survey said they or their doctor challenged an insurer’s denial of claim. Some 45% of respondents said they weren’t sure they had the right to appeal the denial, while 40% said they weren’t sure whom to contact. Nearly a quarter said they didn’t have the time. But challenging the denial can produce results. Half of those who appealed ultimately had their care approved, the Commonwealth Fund survey found. by Medicare Advantage insurers – including UnitedHealthcare, the largest player in the swiftly growing market – have come under fire in recent years, particularly from the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates the program, and from some lawmakers. The insurers, which are paid by the federal government to provide Medicare services to enrollees, have at times delayed or denied beneficiaries’ access to medical care – even though the requests met Medicare coverage rules, according to a from HHS’ inspector general’s office. Annual federal audits have highlighted “widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment,” the office said. A central concern is the potential incentive Medicare Advantage plans have to deny access to services and payments to providers in an attempt to increase profits, the office said. Insurers are given a set amount of money per patient regardless of the amount of care received. UnitedHealthcare, in particular, has come under public scrutiny as it dramatically increased care denials for its Medicare Advantage enrollees. The insurer more than doubled the rate of denials for care following hospital stays between 2020 and 2022 as it implemented machine-assisted technology to automate the process, according to a released in October. That far surpassed its competitors, including Humana, whose care denials grew 54% during the same time period. “Despite alarm and criticism in recent years about abuses and excesses, insurers have continued to deny care to vulnerable seniors—simply to make more money,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement in October. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

From a fresh and different take on a founding father, to an eye-opening portrait of a cherished Ukrainian restaurant in the heart of New York City, here were the titles that got us talking – and have kept us thinking this year. A no-holds-barred look at the man behind the myth, “Super/Man” takes us on , observing his life and career both before and after his fateful 1995 horse riding accident, as well as his relationship with his wife Dana and their profound legacy. In a year that has felt rather discouraging for issues surrounding gender and equality, Diane von Furstenberg’s story showcasing a woman succeeding in the business world – while also uplifting other women around her – is a testament to the value of unstoppable resilience and the desire to stay in the fight. This one sure is a talker – an academic look at , in the context of the 19th century when sexual mores were different – and perhaps less scrutinized with the lack of technology – than they are today. The masterful creative mind behind the Muppets, “Labyrinth,” “The Dark Crystal” and so much more, Henson is the focus of this immersive, Emmy-winning documentary from director Ron Howard, who speaks to fans of the late Henson and uncovers some of his never-before-seen work. While “Barbie”-mania feels firmly behind us as part of 2023, this past summer’s “ ” – produced by Shondaland – examines the impact of Black Barbie on culture and the world, and how the Mattel doll from 1959 vitally and necessarily evolved as a result. With trans themes and rights at the , this – between Will Ferrell and his recently-transitioned former “Saturday Night Live” colleague Harper Steele – allows for frank questions to be asked, giving intimate access into what life is like for one trans woman, in this country today. A heartfelt documentary that charts the evolution of this mainstay in the “Little Ukraine” area of New York City’s East Village for pierogis and goulash, which took on a new meaning when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. This at the late Vandross as a beloved singer and talent features laudatory interviews with the likes of Mariah Carey and Jamie Foxx, but also doesn’t shy away from the media scrutiny he faced in his life. The curiosity surrounding K-Pop and the mania it brings with it has only grown as various acts have broken through on the world stage, and as seen in this docuseries, the phenomenon is showing no signs of slowing down. An emotional look at as they go on an around-the-world tour to take in as many sights as possible before three of their children lose their eyesight due to a rare genetic disorder. An an unconventional talent, this Emmy-nominated two-part feature is bifurcated into “Then” and “Now” examinations of the life of the entertainer, a brilliant comic, actor, writer and producer who “never thought success was a permanent state,” according to “Saturday Night Live” mastermind Lorne Michaels. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Svetlana Dali, a US permanent resident and Russian national, is charged with one count of being a stowaway on a vessel or aircraft without consent. She appeared in federal court in Brooklyn Friday afternoon, where a judge detailed the conditions of her release without paying bail. She could face up to five years in prison if convicted. Judge Joseph Marutollo ruled Dali cannot go to airports, must submit to GPS monitoring, surrender any travel documents and cannot leave the area where she is staying or facing charges. She must also abide by a curfew and be evaluated and submit to any recommended mental health treatment. Dali, 57, will live in Philadelphia with an acquaintance from her church. The acquaintance told the court he was willing to let her live there as she had nowhere else to go. The judge raised a number of concerns about releasing Dali, including her ability to travel without documents and no third-party taking legal responsibility for her, but her attorney noted although she had no one else in the United States, she did have family and a fiancée in Europe. “If you ask us for a third-party custodian, you are going to keep our client in jail,” federal public defense attorney Michael Schneider told the court. “We do not believe she is a serious risk of flight … It’s not as if she can sneak on a flight every day.” Alternately, prosecutor Theodora Brooke said, “We do believe she is a risk of flight,” noting the incident was not a simple case of a three-dollar turnstile hop, but rather a security breach that raised national security and safety concerns. Dali’s attorney had previously likened Dali’s offense to “turnstile hopping” and noted that she did pass security screening. Brooke said Dali told investigators she had tried to stow away before at a number of airports. She highlighted a police report from February 2024 indicating Dali tried to enter a secure arrivals area at Miami International Airport and get through customs to the planes. Dali appeared in court Friday wearing baggy, green khaki prison garb and a hospital bracelet, walking with a cane with a medical sicker on her arm. Prior to the hearing, the court staff noted she was taken to the hospital by ambulance Thursday night after complaining of chest pains. Schneider noted Friday there was little likelihood of her going to jail. Dali, who French authorities identified as the rogue passenger, was arrested by the FBI Wednesday upon her deportation to the US. She first appeared in court Thursday, where she did not enter a plea. During a Thursday hearing, Schneider said Dali complained about at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn, the prison she was housed in Wednesday. She likened it to torture, according to Schneider, saying she was cold and that she didn’t get medical treatment. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which runs the prison, said it doesn’t “comment on the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual,” but is working to address “staffing and other challenges” previously raised during its improvement efforts over the last year. Now that Dali has been charged, officials are sharing a clearer picture of how she made the extraordinary journey, which has raised serious questions about airport security. Here’s what we know: Dali snuck onto Delta flight 264 from New York’s JFK International Airport to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport on November 26. Dali “stated that she did not have a plane ticket and that she intentionally evaded TSA security officials and Delta employees so that she could travel without buying one,” the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleged in a criminal complaint filed Thursday. Investigators reviewed surveillance footage at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport and noted Dali was turned away at a Transportation Security Administration security checkpoint because she didn’t have a boarding pass, according to the complaint. But five minutes later she returned and was able to get past the TSA checkpoint by going to a lane for airline employees. She proceeded to a departing gate where “Delta agents, who were busy helping ticketed passengers board, did not stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass before she boarded the plane,” the complaint said. Attempting to stay undiscovered, she hid in the bathroom to remain out of the crew’s sight, according to one passenger account. “I overheard the flight attendants talking about it with the pilots,” New York City real estate broker Rob Jackson told CNN. “They said this person was in one lavatory and then would exit and walk to a different lavatory and go in there for a long time.” Crew members did not alert passengers to the stowaway in their midst until the flight landed in the French capital, Jackson said. “The first announcement to passengers that there was a problem was when we parked at the gate and they instructed us all to remain seated because French police were going to board the aircraft to deal with ‘a serious security issue,’” he said. In a video recorded by Jackson, a voice on the plane’s intercom says, “Folks, this is the captain, we are just waiting for the police to come on board. They may be here now and they directed us to keep everyone on the airplane until we sort out the extra passenger that’s on the plane.” Dali was detained by French police, who found she was ineligible to enter the country and ordered her to be sent back to the US. Records indicate Dali once lived in the Philadelphia area. Authorities have not said whether she had tried to sneak onto a plane before, or if she was previously known to law enforcement. It is unclear how long she had been in the United States. Dali has filed two lawsuits in recent months alleging that she is the victim of military-grade chemical weapons and a kidnapping plot, according to court records. She had applied for asylum in France a few years ago, a Paris airport official told CNN. Following her detention at the Paris airport, she was scheduled to return to the US on Saturday – but was removed from a Delta flight to New York after creating a disturbance before takeoff. She eventually took off on Wednesday. Wearing a black jacket, pale gray beanie and a pink scarf, Dali sat quietly in the middle aisle at the back of the plane, flanked by two French security officials. During the flight, she occasionally leaned her head against the seat in front of her and stared at the floor or closed her eyes and listened to music. Dali declined to speak with CNN after landing. CNN has attempted to contact Dali’s family and friends to find out more about her. Dali bypassed an employee in charge of the Known Crewmember checkpoint at JFK Terminal 4, then got through checkpoints where her ID and boarding pass should have been verified, a Transportation Security Administration spokesperson told CNN. At the gate, she placed herself in the middle of what appeared to be a family traveling together, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. She was not carrying any prohibited items, according to a TSA spokesperson. Asked repeatedly to describe what took place at the gate, Delta has not commented. The airline said it had reviewed its own security after the incident and insisted its infrastructure “is sound.” Delta blamed the breach on a “deviation from standard procedures,” but did not specify how it strayed from its usual security practices. “We are thoroughly addressing this matter and will continue to work closely with our regulators, law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders,” Delta said in a statement. “Nothing is of greater importance than safety and security.” CNN has reached out to Delta to ask whether Dali will be banned by the airline. TSA inspectors are also preparing a civil case against Dali after reviewing security video from inside JFK Airport, an agency spokesperson told CNN. The TSA cannot bring criminal charges, though it can refer them to the Justice Department. The incident should serve as a “wake-up call” for the airline industry, according to a CNN aviation analyst. Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation, said, “It’s a really big deal and it leaves our vulnerabilities exposed to the world.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The ruling clears the way for the jury to consider a remaining lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. It came after a Manhattan jury said they were deadlocked twice on the manslaughter charge and Penny’s defense attorneys renewed their motion for a mistrial. Over defense objections, Judge Maxwell Wiley agreed with prosecutors, who argued that dismissing the first count of second-degree manslaughter eliminates the defense’s concern about a compromise verdict. Penny, 26, a former Marine, now faces a single charge of criminally negligent homicide in Neely’s death, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison, significantly less than a potential maximum sentence of 15 years tied to the more serious charge. The judge could also choose to sentence Penny to no prison time if he is convicted. Penny could not have been convicted of both charges, according to the judge’s instructions to the jury. Wiley told the jury the second-degree manslaughter charge has been dismissed, functionally allowing them to now consider the remaining charge of criminally negligent homicide. “What that means is you are now free to consider Count 2. Whether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea,” the judge told the jury after updating them. Judge Wiley had instructed the jurors to keep deliberating after they were deadlocked on the charge earlier in the day. Penny’s defense attorneys objected and moved for a mistrial over the deadlocked panel of 12 Manhattanites. After informing them of the manslaughter charge dismissal, Judge Wiley sent the jury home earlier than usual, telling the panel to “think about something else” over the weekend. The jury will return Monday morning to continue deliberations on the remaining charge. “It’s not time for a mistrial,” Wiley told the attorneys outside the presence of the jury, after the jury first reported being deadlocked. Shortly before the judge’s ruling, lead prosecutor Dafna Yoran had indicated her office would drop the second-degree manslaughter charge if the jury could move on to consider the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. Defense attorney Thomas Kenniff objected to the motion, telling the judge he was unaware of any legal precedent for the prosecution’s proposal and called it “novel.” Granting the proposal, Kenniff argued, would “encourage prosecutors’ offices to overcharge in the grand jury.” Penny’s defense attorney made clear they would appeal Wiley’s decision if the jury ultimately convicts Penny on the criminally negligent homicide charge. Wiley acknowledged there may not be an explicit precedent for his ruling, telling the attorneys, “I’ll take a chance and grant the prosecution’s application.” Explaining his rationale, the judge said it is a unique case because typically in an indictment including a lesser charge, there is a “very clear” difference between the counts, but in this case, he said, there is not. “We are obviously very pleased with the Court’s decision to withdraw the top count of this indictment,” Keniff said in a statement Friday evening. “However, we have always maintained that Danny acted reasonably in restraining Jordan Neely, and justice will not be served until he is acquitted of criminally negligent homicide as well. We are hopeful that will happen when the jury returns on Monday.” Neely, a 30-year-old street artist who struggled with homelessness, mental illness and drugs, on May 1, 2023, and began acting erratically. He threw down his jacket and yelled at passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and didn’t care whether he died, witnesses said. Penny, a subway passenger, grabbed Neely from behind in a chokehold, forced him to the train floor and restrained him there for several minutes. When police arrived and Penny let go of the hold, Neely was nonresponsive. Several were captured on bystander video that quickly went viral. That video, as well as Penny’s interview with NYPD investigators explaining his actions and autopsy findings, were central pieces of evidence in the trial. “I wasn’t trying to injure him,” Penny told police. “I’m just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else. He was threatening.” Prosecutors have said Penny acted recklessly by restraining Neely in a chokehold for so long, even after Neely stopped moving, while his defense has said he was acting to protect others from a threat. The case has polarized NYC residents, many of whom have personal experiences with disorder on the subways, and raised broader questions about mental health, race relations and the line between protector and vigilante. Black Lives Matter protesters have added Neely’s name to its roll call of victims – including just outside the courthouse – while others have praised Penny’s efforts to try to protect others. , the defense argued Penny “was justified in the actions he took to protect the other riders.” Neely “was on a collision course with himself” and Penny “acted when others could not,” defense attorney Steven Raiser said during his two-hour closing argument. The defense also has challenged the medical examiner’s determination Neely died from the chokehold and suggested the charges were brought because of “a rush to judgment based on something other than medical science.” Prosecutor Dafna Yoran, in her closing arguments, said Penny intended to protect fellow passengers but “he just didn’t recognize that Jordan Neely’s life too needed to be preserved.” “We are here today because the defendant used way too much force for way too long in way too reckless of a manner,” she said. The trial began with jury selection in late October and has from subway riders, responding police officers and martial arts and medical experts. The prosecution called more than 30 witnesses to the stand, including one man who helped restrain Neely’s arms during the struggle and testified he advised Penny to loosen his grip. “I’m going to grab his hands so you can let go,” Eric Gonzalez told Penny, according to his testimony. Further, Gonzalez could be heard in video footage of the incident saying that Penny wasn’t “squeezing” Neely’s neck in the 51 seconds before he released the chokehold. Gonzalez also testified he initially lied to investigators about what he saw and did on the subway out of fear he would be “pinned” for the killing. Prosecutors promised not to charge him in the case, he testified. In addition, the Marine Corps martial arts expert who trained Penny in chokeholds testified that Penny was aware the holds could be lethal. Several subway riders testified they were terrified Neely was going to attack and that they were relieved when Penny put him in a chokehold and kept him there. “Restraining him for the moment was a relief, but if he would have gotten up, he would have done what he would have done,” subway rider Caedryn Schrunk said. The defense’s case focused on emphasizing Neely’s threatening behavior, character witnesses from Penny’s time in the US Marines and challenges to the medical cause of Neely’s death. Penny served four years in the Marines as a sergeant, from 2017 to 2021, with his last duty assignment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to military records. The city medical examiner who performed Neely’s autopsy, testifying for the prosecution, ruled the cause of his death was “compression of neck (chokehold).” She made that determination after performing an autopsy and watching the cell phone video on the subway but did not wait for the toxicology report, she testified. The defense presented its own medical expert who said Neely died of a combination of factors, including a sickling crisis linked to his sickle cell trait, a schizophrenic episode, the struggle and restraint by Penny and K2 intoxication. The jury began deliberating on Tuesday afternoon. Over the first two days of deliberations, jurors sent several notes to the court requesting to review video evidence and rehear parts of the jury instructions and testimony during the trial. Separately, Neely’s father filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on Wednesday accusing Penny of assault, battery and causing Neely’s death. Andre Zachery, who is listed as the administrator of Neely’s estate, accused Penny of having caused the death “by the reason of the negligence, carelessness and recklessness.” The suit does not specify the amount of money the family is seeking. Penny’s defense attorney Kenniff did not respond to a request for comment on the suit. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Federal Reserve officials are taking the November jobs report with a big grain of salt. The report, released Friday morning, estimated employers hired 227,000 new workers last month, beating economists’ expectations and surging past October’s dismal 36,000 new hires. But at the same time, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1% in October. “It can be dangerous to focus too much on one release because it may be subject to revisions and reflect idiosyncratic factors like the impact of hurricanes and strikes,” Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said Friday at an event hosted by The City Club of Cleveland. Overall, she said recent trends indicate the labor market is getting into better balance from the pandemic, when employers had to contend with shortages. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said last month’s job gains were higher than he anticipated, but said he’s not reading too much into it. Instead, he said he’s taking into account recent averages of monthly job gains. In that regard, the labor market is at a level of “sustainable full employment,” Goolsbee said Friday at a conference. Full employment refers to a situation where labor supply and labor demand are in balance, meaning job seekers are able to find new work with relative ease and employers with open roles can similarly fill positions easily. Fed Governor Michele Bowman said the labor market’s strength continues to outperform her expectations. In her view, the rise in the unemployment rate over the past year “largely reflects weaker hiring as the layoffs continue to remain low,” she said Friday at an event hosted by the Missouri Bankers Association. But she cautioned it’s been more challenging for her to get a good read on what’s happening in the labor market from monthly government job reports with frequent substantial revisions as well as immigration effects. Wall Street was mixed after the November jobs report, with the Dow initially moving higher but then falling by 110 points, or 0.25% by midday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both reached new intraday highs. Traders were reassured by the better-than-expected total of 227,000 jobs added last month, and bets rose for a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on December 18. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 4.2% from 4.1% and the labor force participation rate ticked down. Overall, the November employment data has “ambiguous implications” that Fed officials will need to parse, said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “On the one hand, there’s clearly more slack in the job market than a year or two ago — that argues for more rate cuts. On the other hand, wage growth continues to run faster than in the pre-pandemic period, which could sustain inflationary pressures in labor-intensive industries — and that argues against them.” The government’s latest employment figures show that America’s job market remains in good shape overall. In the six months through November, employers have added a solid 143,000 jobs a month, on average. Unemployment is up from levels seen a year earlier but remains historically low, hovering within a narrow range over the past several months. Wage growth has continued to outpace inflation. Here are other trends reflected in the November jobs report: As part of his campaign to reclaim the White House, President-elect Donald Trump made clear that in a second term in office, he’d move tens of thousands of federal jobs outside the “Washington swamp” and into “places filled with patriots who love America.” “This,” Trump said in one campaign video, “is how I will shatter the deep state.” The relocation of federal jobs outside Washington, DC, was something Trump embarked on near the end of his first term — the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management about 2,000 miles west to Grand Junction, Colorado. But if that move is any indication of what’s to come, the massive push to relocate federal jobs outside the Beltway comes with the risk of kneecapping agencies through the loss of experienced workers and bogging them down in logistical minutia. The BLM move became an unproductive debacle marked by an exodus of experienced employees and a surge in vacancies that arguably undermined the then-Trump administration’s agenda, according to a half dozen current and former senior BLM staffers — including the agency’s current director — and a CNN review of government records. That western relocation was “wildly disruptive” and should serve as a “cautionary tale” for the incoming Trump administration, said Tracy Stone-Manning, the Biden administration’s BLM director. “It’s years of opportunity cost when we could and should be focused on the work of the bureau, for public lands and the American people, and we had to instead focus on rebuilding the bureau,” Stone-Manning said. “We are still piecing it back together.” Read more . “The labor market is healthy even though it is, in the long term, trending in an unhealthy direction,” Noah Yosif, chief economist for the American Staffing Association, told CNN in an interview Friday. “What we’re seeing is really a K-shaped duality of outcomes for the labor market: It’s good if you have a job, but it’s very, very difficult if you don’t have a job.” The unemployment rate ticked up last month to 4.2% from 4.1%, and a growing number of jobless Americans are — a reflection of a pullback in hiring. People are staying unemployed, on average, for a little more than five months, the highest duration since April 2022, according to data released Friday. Americans are continuing to emerge from their yearslong funk. The University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey, released Friday, showed that sentiment climbed in December for the fifth month in a row, “rising about 3% to its highest reading in seven months,” according to a release. November’s perkier mood was driven by consumers perceiving favorable buying conditions for durables (goods meant to last at least three years, such as cars and furniture.) The Federal Reserve has pared back interest rates twice this year so far, and seems to be on track to cut rates again later this month. Durable goods are usually purchased with credit. “Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases,” said Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, in a release. Republicans continued to feel optimistic about the economy, following President-elect Donald Trump’s win for a second term in early November, while Democrats grew more pessimistic. “Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation,” Hsu said. “Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation.” While businesses and others are sounding the alarm about the potential for stark labor shortages and economic risk, one has to go back only a couple of years to see how labor shortages hindered the economic recovery. “We lived it,” Sam Sanchez, a Chicago restaurateur, told CNN in an interview. “There was no labor force. Everybody was collecting $1,000 a week for a year and a half. People were traveling around the world, and people refused to come to work.” The pandemic leveled in-person industries, and the restaurant sector was among the hardest hit, losing millions of jobs overnight. While unemployment benefits were extended to affected workers, the demand for workers outstripped the supply for a variety of reasons, including health and safety concerns, caregiving needs and people switching careers. It took years for the restaurant industry to return to its pre-pandemic job totals. Read more . Federal Reserve officials expressed greater confidence about America’s job market in the days leading up to Friday’s latest employment data. The Fed’s so-called dual mandate calls for the central bank to promote maximum employment and stable prices. The job market has steadily slowed throughout 2024, but there were a few rough patches this year. For example, the July jobs report, released in early August, came in much weaker than expected. Some economists said that encouraged the Fed to deliver a large, half-point rate cut in September. Subsequent data showed unemployment remaining historically low and job growth holding steady (stripping out the distortions to October data from hurricanes and labor strikes.) Here’s what Fed officials have said recently about the US labor market: For several months, government hiring has accounted for some of the top gains across all industries. For instance, last month the government hired 33,000 new workers, making it the third top sector that saw gains in November. Much of the growth in the sector over the past year came from state and local hiring. Part of the equation has also been from the federal government side, where employment has grown and shed very few jobs. But the government sector as a whole could soon turn into the one experiencing the greatest monthly job as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who lead President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, pledged to more federal workers. “The number of federal employees to cut should be at least proportionate to the number of federal regulations that are nullified,” Musk and Ramaswamy in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. Trump has also vowed to abolish the Department of Education, which could result in layoffs as well. Currently, more than 3 million people are federal government employees, according to data from the November jobs report. That’s about 37,000 more federal employees compared to a year ago. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su touted the November jobs report Friday, telling CNN the October report was “an aberration” and that last month’s data was “much more consistent with what we’ve seen throughout the year, which is a story of continued growth.” The acting Labor Secretary, however, acknowledged that promising economic indicators did not always translate to consumer confidence under the Biden administration, telling CNN it would take a while for Americans to feel a number of President Joe Biden’s signature economic achievements. “Working people have been seeing their situation decline for decades — it’s going to take more than four years to reverse that, and it’s going to take more than four years for people to really feel secure again,” she said. She also said: “We are handing off the strongest economy in history to the next administration.” The Dow opened 86 points, or 0.2% higher Friday; the S&P 500 moved up by 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%, as investors continue to expect a rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month. Wall Street parsed the latest jobs report, which showed that the US economy added a better-than-expected 227,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Traders are betting that despite the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, the Fed will still announce a quarter-point cut in its benchmark interest rate at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on December 17-18. However, they reduced their bets to 87% from 91% earlier in the day, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Wall Street became more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again this month after the release of the November jobs report. Investors’ bets that the Fed will deliver a quarter-point rate cut stood at around 72% before the report’s release at 8:30 a.m. ET, according to the futures market. Those odds were at roughly 87% shortly after the stock market opened. The Fed seems to be on track to deliver this year’s third rate cut at its December 17-18 meeting mostly because it seems that elevated borrowing costs still have tight grip on the economy, coupled with the belief that inflation is destined to slow further, despite recent inflation data coming in slightly hotter than expected. When the Fed began to cut in September, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said central bankers want to prevent any deterioration in the labor market. There have been some lingering signs of underlying fragility, such as the concentration of job growth over the past year. “If you look at private sector job growth, and you exclude health care and education, growth has mainly been driven by hospitality, while other cyclical sectors are not generating a lot of net job gains,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN. “This concentration of job growth is not as positive as the aggregate numbers suggest. I think the Federal Reserve is aware of that.” Other examples of a vulnerable job market include the steady run-up in unemployment over the past year, even though the latest rate remains at a historically low level, and longer stretches of joblessness, according to data on unemployment claims. Through November, the US economy has added an average of 180,363 jobs per month, which is considerably cooler growth than what was seen during the post-pandemic rebound. However, the current monthly average is right in line with what was seen during 2010 to 2019 — the longest period of job expansion on record. And this current labor market is also becoming historic: With November’s gains, the US has added jobs for 47 consecutive months, making it the third-longest period of employment expansion on record. The October jobs report was clearly “just a bump in the road to economic prosperity,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. “The economy is doing just fine, and the hopes for multiple Fed rate cuts next year are literally dying on the vine. The economy’s strength is just another sign that the Federal Reserve’s interest rates are not at restrictive levels that slow growth,” he wrote in commentary issued Friday. “Washington does not need to be tinkering with measures to boost the economy as jobs are plentiful,” Rupkey wrote. “The inflation fire has not been put out, with core consumer price increases still elevated and another pop in wages or average hourly earnings in this month’s report.” US futures rose slightly after the November jobs report was released Friday morning. Futures on the Dow ticked up by around 50 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were higher by 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The Labor Department revealed Friday that the US economy added 227,000 jobs last month, besting expectations for 200,000 and a massive bounce back after October’s 36,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Traders are still expecting the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point at its policy meeting later this month. There is currently a 91% certainty that a quarter-point cut will be announced on December 18, according to the CME FedWatch tool, an increase from the 72% certainty before the report. A big question in the November jobs report was whether new revisions to October’s employment data would paint a more positive picture of the labor market. The Department of Labor originally estimated employers hired just 12,000 workers that month, partly as a result of hurricanes and labor strikes. But many economists believed that as the agency received more subsequent data, it would show that hiring was actually much stronger than originally reported. The new estimates indicate that’s true — but only very slightly: The DOL reported Friday that US employers hired 36,000 new workers in October, an upward revision of 24,000 jobs. Still, for September, new revised estimates point to employers hiring 255,000 new workers versus the 223,000 previously estimated. November’s biggest job creators were mostly the usual categories that have powered America’s labor market this year. Employers in private education and health services added a robust 79,000 jobs in November, the most of any sector. Health care contributed 54,000 of those jobs, which included roles in ambulatory services, home health and nursing. Leisure and hospitality was November’s second-biggest job creator, expanding headcount by a strong 53,000, mostly encompassing jobs in restaurants. It was also the industry’s biggest monthly gain since March. Government added 33,000 positions. Manufacturing also saw a strong month of job growth in November, with its biggest monthly increase in a year. Employment in the industry has contracted in six of the past 11 months through November. Retail trade lost the most jobs of any industry in November, shedding 28,000. Job growth an expected rebound after hurricanes and striking workers . The US economy added 227,000 jobs last month, as striking and weather-waylaid employees went back to work and bolstered a steady stream of employment gains, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. October’s job gains, which tallied 12,000 in the first estimate, were revised higher to 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% for the third month in a row. Economists were expecting a net gain of 200,000 jobs and for the unemployment rate to stay at 4.1%, according to FactSet. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the November jobs data at 8:30 am ET, it is expected to show a sharp rebound from an October report that was by back-to-back hurricanes and a major labor strike. “We had a report last month for which I told my readers, ‘Just throw it away,’” said Dan North, Allianz Trade’s senior economist for North America. “So, what’s going to happen this coming month? Is there going to be a huge bounce back? Well, that would be rational.” When plugging in those striking and weather-waylaid workers, November’s report is expected to show a net gain of 207,500 jobs, according to consensus estimates on FactSet. The unemployment rate — which has served as an unofficial polestar amid the wild distortions — is expected to remain at 4.1%, where it’s been since September. “The Boeing strike, the hurricanes, and now the prospect of large-scale deportations make the headline jobs numbers difficult to read,” said Dean Baker, senior economist at CEPR, in a note this week. “Nonetheless, the overall labor market picture still looks mostly strong, albeit with some serious question marks.” First-time claims for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week to their highest level since mid-October, new data showed Thursday. However, the level of claims remained fairly steady, an indication of a slowing but stable labor market. Americans made an estimated 224,000 initial claims for jobless benefits during the week that ended November 30, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday. That’s an increase of 9,000 claims from the upwardly revised tally a week before. Economists were expecting for the number of initial claims to land at 214,000 filing, which would have been a slight uptick, according to FactSet estimates. Despite the upswing in initial claims, the number of continuing claims — which are filed by people who have received unemployment insurance for at least a week or more — fell by 25,000 to 1.871 million during the week that ended November 23. Continuing claims had recently bumped up against a three-year high, indicating that it may be taking longer for unemployed people to find work. Private employers hired 146,000 new workers last month, according to payroll processor ADP. That missed economists’ forecasts for 157,000 gains, per FactSet consensus estimates. November’s gains mark a big decline from October, when employers hired 184,000 new workers, according to revised data. “While overall growth for the month was healthy, industry performance was mixed,” ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said in a statement Wednesday morning. “Manufacturing was the weakest we’ve seen since spring,” she added. The sector shed 26,000 jobs last month. The report likely leaves the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates further at its meeting this month as it looks to strengthen the labor market. ADP’s report is viewed by some as a proxy for the official jobs report. US employers were looking to hire more workers in October compared to the prior month, according to new data the Labor Department released Tuesday. The level of job openings nationwide rose to 7.7 million in October from 7.4 million in September, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). That beat economists’ expectations of 7.5 million job openings for October, according to consensus estimates from FactSet. The number of people quitting their jobs rose by 228,000 to 3.3 million in October from September. But, compared to a year ago, the number of quits is down by 308,000. Also, the number of people laid off from jobs declined by 169,000 in October to 1.6 million from September. However, in a more unsettling sign for the labor market, the hiring rate fell to 3.3% in October, the lowest level since 2013. The hiring rate measures the share of new hires represented in the total number of people employed. The Federal Reserve is likely still on track to cut interest rates at its meeting this month as it continues to focus on strengthening the labor market. The October jobs report total came in far below the already-low expectations for a 112,500-job gain: The US economy added just 12,000 jobs that month. That’s because of temporary shocks to the US labor market, including two major deadly hurricanes and . “Between storms, labor strikes and data collection issues, the labor market numbers we’re seeing today should be taken with a grain of salt,” Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, wrote in commentary after the October repor was released. “Even though they came in lower than anticipated with that in mind, the news doesn’t warrant panic about overall economic health.” Economists had warned that , making it much harder to interpret the true underlying health of the labor market. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said as much, noting a shorter data-gathering period was exacerbated by collection efforts in weather-affected regions. However, amid the murkiness in the payroll data, the unemployment rate (which is generated by a different survey that doesn’t count weather-affected workers as unemployed) provided a signal of stability in the labor market: It held steady at 4.1%. Read more . The coming weeks and months could shift the narrative for the labor market, inflation and the overall economy. President-elect Donald Trump is promising massive tariffs (which economists say could come at a cost to US businesses and consumers) as well as mass deportations and immigration restrictions. The rebound and subsequent surge in immigration following the pandemic has contributed greatly to monthly job gains. “Labor supply has been one of the reasons the Fed’s been able to cut to this point,” Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank, said in an interview. “If that equation changes, it’s another reason not to cut. And our baseline forecast is, we don’t have [the Fed] cutting again after the December meeting. We don’t have them cutting at all next year.” The specter of looming policy changes is already reverberating on Main Streets across America. “People are afraid of walking the streets right now; there’s a lot of fear … a lot of fear. The employees will start getting worried and say, ‘Should I go to work? Should I take a chance?’” restaurateur Sam Sanchez, a member of the American Business Immigration Coalition, which advocates for business-friendly immigration reform, told CNN in an interview.

That’s because a nominee doesn’t “pass” a background check, and the FBI doesn’t approve applicants. Instead, the FBI’s investigative files on nominees are sent to the White House, which makes the final decision on whether they can hold the positions to which the president appointed them. FBI background checks have been lightning rods during previous contentious confirmation fights. After sexual misconduct allegations nearly tanked Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination in 2018, for example, Democrats said the FBI background investigation was politically constrained and did not follow proper procedures. Hegseth’s confirmation has been in jeopardy amid a series of allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct, which he has denied. As calls for additional vetting have mounted, Hegseth’s attorney told CNN this week that his name has been submitted to the FBI for the background check. The FBI is gearing up to conduct detailed background checks on thousands of appointees for Trump’s incoming administration. While the president-elect has been moving quickly to name his Cabinet and key administrative picks, his use of the FBI system had been in question until the Trump transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department in recent days. The agreement will now allow the FBI to conduct at least some investigations, but it remains unclear how many of Trump’s candidates to lead various agencies and departments will be submitted for those checks, as the transition team also has been using private companies to conduct some vetting. Despite Trump’s qualms about the FBI and complaints from his allies that the bureau shouldn’t be trusted to screen his appointees, the FBI system does enjoy bipartisan support from members of Congress. Senators of both parties have said they want political appointees to undergo FBI background investigations as part of the confirmation process. Dozens of FBI agents and contractors at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington and in field offices around the country are involved in background investigations with the goal of helping to prepare the new administration to take the reins of government and allow appointees to have access to classified and other sensitive information as soon as the new president is inaugurated on January 20. The background checks aren’t criminal investigations, and the FBI investigators’ role is to conduct investigations for a client – in this case the White House or government agency that requests them. In each administration, the White House typically provides questions, in addition to the standard ones listed on the application forms, that agents are told to ask. While FBI background investigations have access to government criminal databases, that typically wouldn’t include allegations of wrongdoing that don’t result in an arrest or charges. In Hegseth’s case, that means investigators wouldn’t necessarily see details from a California incident that included an investigation of alleged sexual assault but didn’t result in charges. It’s unclear whether investigators would be able to seek information from the accuser, who was that included a confidentiality clause and has the option to decline to speak to the FBI. The scope of the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh is still under scrutiny. In releasing a this fall, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called the bureau’s supplemental background probe into Kavanaugh a “sham.” Background checks include long forms where candidates must detail past employment, biographical information, as well as criminal and financial records. Investigators probe each applicant’s personal history back to their 18th birthday, with FBI security specialists examining credit histories and criminal backgrounds and conducting interviews of associates dating back years. The investigations also include an in-person FBI interview where an agent reviews information gathered and sometimes challenges applicants to explain discrepancies. “I compare it to a colorectal examination while you’re awake,” a former FBI security specialist who conducted background investigations for years told CNN. The investigations for Cabinet members can include as many as 60 interviews, the former FBI specialist said. Agents and contractors spend 10 days to two weeks on the highest-profile investigations. Applicants are asked to provide contacts with employers dating back to age 18. The FBI develops its own intelligence to supplement the list of people who may know an applicant to ensure it doesn’t miss information that an applicant may leave out. In some cases, agents will walk up and down the street where someone lived to ask neighbors about them. For appointees who previously served in government jobs, the investigations tend to be shorter since agents don’t need to duplicate the investigation of earlier parts of the background. The incoming Trump administration has a tortured past with the government’s security clearance system after dozens of people he picked to serve in his first administration struggled to complete the background investigations process. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, was among several appointees whose foreign contacts and potential conflicts posed issues as they sought to receive security clearances. In Kushner’s case, incomplete information he provided in filing out the government form, known as SF-86, caused delays. Trump ordered high-level clearances be granted to about 25 people, including to Kushner and his daughter Ivanka, dismissing questions raised during the background investigations, according to congressional testimony. © 2024 Cable News Network.

In a copy of the lawsuit provided by Google, the company said the CFPB’s supervision would be a “burdensome form of regulation” imposed based on a “small number of unsubstantiated user complaints.” The CFPB’s decision related to a Google peer-to-peer payment product no longer offered in the United States. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court in Washington, DC, comes after the CFPB published announcing supervisory authority of Google Payment Corp. The agency alleged that Google’s handling of its payment products may pose a risk to consumers. The CFPB cited customer complaints, including that Google failed to properly investigate instances where money was transferred in error. The legal fight between Google and the CFPB, the government agency founded to enforce consumer protection laws, comes amid a push by big tech companies, including Google, Apple and Samsung, into financial products. In a statement, Google spokesperson José Castañeda said Google’s payment products never posed a risk to users. “This is a clear case of government overreach involving Google Pay peer-to-peer payments, which never raised risks and is in the U.S., and we are challenging it in court,” he said. In the company’s lawsuit, Google argued that the CFPB committed a legal error by setting an “exceedingly low bar” for what it counts as sufficient risks to consumers. “As a matter of common sense, a product that no longer exists is incapable of posing such risks,” the lawsuit said. However, the CFPB said the discontinuation of Google’s payment products did not release it from agency supervision. Supervisory authority over Google’s payments division would allow the CFPB to oversee its operations, ensuring they comply with consumer financial laws. In Google’s lawsuit, the company alleged the CFPB would subject Google to on-site examinations and requests for confidential documents and information. In 2022, the CFPB announced it would begin examining nonbank financial institutions that pose a risk to consumers. “This authority gives us critical agility to move as quickly as the market, allowing us to conduct examinations of financial companies posing risks to consumers and stop harm before it spreads,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in 2022.

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn a commission. If you’re planning a destination this winter, a or isn’t the answer. The money you’d pay for multiple rooms and small quarters (especially during the holidays) is better spent on a spacious cottage, cabin or chalet. And the ability to cook your meals and warm up beside a roaring communal fireplace in the privacy of a welcoming social room can help to make your celebrations more intimate. Even if you’re not planning a large get-together, Airbnb can deliver unique stays in where hotels simply don’t exist. , these are the best places for a dazzling winter vacation — from the East Coast to , from the Great White North to the southernmost tip of Australia. This updated cottage attached to a 100-year-old farmhouse gushes yesteryear vibes with its quaint décor, outdoor festoon lights and serene location. You’ll almost certainly spot chickens and alpacas during your dip in the hot tub, as well. Though seemingly in the middle of nowhere, you’re just a few minutes’ drive from charming small towns, wineries, breweries and top-tier restaurants. Whether you’re looking to go off the grid or just enjoy the simpler life, this rural-but-accessible two-bedroom home is excellent for a family of five. This simultaneously cozy and expansive property is exactly what you think of when you imagine a warm haven buried in snow. You’ll have access to two side-by-side cabins — a main cabin with four bedrooms, and a guest cabin with one bedroom (six beds in total). It’s all about fire with these cabins: There are two indoor fireplaces (you can imagine the tranquilizing scent that welcomes you when you first swing open the door). There’s also an outdoor fire pit at the very edge of Lake Muskoday. It’s also worth noting that you’ll have access to lake toys like kayaks, a paddle board and an electric pontoon boat if you choose to visit in the summer. Needless to say, this fun Alaska cabin is near the top of the map. North Pole, Alaska (near Fairbanks) is cold, snowy and stunning. It sounds like the middle of nowhere, but there’s plenty to see and do — including skiing, ice fishing, dog mushing and more. You can even pop over to the Chena Hot Springs if you’re willing to drive about an hour. Admittedly, the cabin is on the smaller side; you’ll have a tough time shoehorning any extended family into a holiday party thrown at this unique home. Instead, it’s more about the once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you’d like to feel like the last family on Earth, this jaw-dropping French chalet is hard to compete with. To be surrounded by nature is the single draw to its location, with nearby lakes, waterfalls and of course, the brisk, fresh oxygen pouring out of the surrounding forest. Inside are traditional chalet appointments, including an all-wood look with A-frame ceilings, large windows and a spacious deck. It’s a perfect base camp for exploring the wilderness. For travel during the winter holidays, it’s no wonder that this picturesque cabin plotted in the middle of a Christmas tree farm is in the top 1% of homes on Airbnb. There are plenty of ways to keep warm in the winter, including a gas fireplace, a log burner, a hot tub and a fire pit. This is yet another property too intimate for a large gathering, with a maximum capacity for two guests. However, there are two huts on site. With considerable shared spaces, this could be an unforgettable trip for four. No home can boast about its “wellness” perks quite like this rustic villa — both for mind and body. Located beside a gorgeous lake in the middle of Lapland, Finland, you’ll have a front row seat to nature on steroids. Think reindeer casually walking through the yard; think vibrant Northern Lights after a breathtaking orange sunset; think ice swimming and fishing. In addition to the home’s unbeatable views through its liberal use of glass, you’ll get an outdoor hot tub, motorized Tempur bed and sauna. It’s the ultimate place for up to six guests to recharge. If you’re an old soul who is convinced you were born in the wrong era, give yourself a chance to experience the old world with a truly fantastic stay along the Rhine River in Germany. Though 350 years old, the property has been updated only where it matters. The space feels fresh and clean — not dusty and worn, as you’ll often experience when staying in a centuries-old building. Its two bedrooms can host up to six guests comfortably. Glass walls — That’s this tiny home’s star feature. It sits strategically atop a hill to give you astonishing panoramic views of the surrounding rugged valley. Encircled by alpine trees, you’ll feel invigorated sucking in nature’s breath mint while you relax in the outdoor jacuzzi. You’ll have use of both an indoor fireplace and an outdoor wood-burning oven. And oh yeah, it’s got heated floors. With two bedrooms, the property can house up to four guests. Okay, this option isn’t exactly luxury. But it’s something you’ll be talking about until the day you die. A double bed in an ice dome is cool in more ways than one. The host even allows up to four guests per igloo. On site is also a warm restaurant and hangout area where you can spend most of your time if it turns out that chilling under the snow isn’t your scene. Europe is always a good idea, but the winter months accentuate the charm of small towns dotted across the continent — particularly in alpine villages around Switzerland. This chalet is top-tier in terms of location, from its spot beside illustrious Lake Geneva to its elevated spot in Montreux that gives you unforgettable views of the surrounding mountains. And its roomy rooftop is the perfect place to enjoy it all. No, it’s not winter in the southern hemisphere. But that doesn’t mean you can’t spend your holiday PTO at the very bottom of Australia. Near Melbourne is one of the most devastatingly gorgeous villas you’ve ever seen. And with a maximum capacity of 10, you and the family can do some serious holidaying. Throughout the property is a ubiquity of wood, stone and concrete. In terms of quality, everything about the home looks really, really heavy (and that’s a good thing). From a fireplace to a Bose sound system to a chef’s kitchen, you’ll want for nothing during your stay here. Again, cold weather isn’t mandatory for a good holiday vacation. Smack dab between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo in balmy southern Brazil is another beyond-words home that looks sort of like a rich Bond villain’s hideout. With ultra-high ceilings, hammocks galore and sliding glass walls to create an indoor/outdoor vibe, this home is perhaps the best equipped to host a party. You’ll also get two in-room jacuzzis and a heated outdoor pool. CNN Underscored strives to be the most reliable resource for travel and product recommendations. Our editorial team travels often and has tested each reviewed product. We have painstakingly researched, working with experts when necessary, to give you the most well-rounded and unbiased opinions. For this article on the best Airbnbs for a winter getaway, we’ve kept abreast of the hottest properties to book according to Airbnb — to give you the early scoop. Choosing the best Airbnb depends entirely on your situation. If you’re after the largest number of twinkly lights per capita, you can choose a location near world-famous Christmas markets (such as Prague or Vienna). Or, if you’re trying to escape the cold, you can head south to warm retreats like Baja California or Brazil. There is a wide variety of Airbnb properties, giving the travel platform a massive advantage over standard hotels. You can rent small cottages beside a lake, cabins along rugged mountain terrain, yurts in the unforgiving wilderness of Alaska, chalets in alpine villages for avid skiers, beachfront bungalows for barefoot luxury and even treehouses with breathtaking views. Airbnbs may decorate for the holidays, but it’s entirely up to the discretion of the host. Those that do will sometimes advertise this fact as an additional draw to convince you to celebrate at their property. In short, don’t count on it unless specifically mentioned. The best holidays to book an Airbnb are those that are often associated with large gatherings and/or any for which you plan to make your own meals — such as Thanksgiving. The extra space and ability to stay under the same roof is more conducive to family time. For the extra space and the residential amenities you receive, Airbnbs are often much cheaper than hotels. They also exist in many places that hotels don’t to give you considerably more flexibility with where you vacation. Receive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.

I mean, people were a little bit concerned,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker in an interview at Trump Tower. “He’s a young guy with a tremendous track record. Actually, went to Princeton and went to Harvard. He was a good student at both, but he loves the military, and I think people are starting to see it. So, we’ll be working on his nomination, along with a lot of others.” Asked whether he thinks Hegseth can earn Senate confirmation, Trump said, “I think he will, yeah. I’ve had a lot of senators call me up saying he’s fantastic.” But Trump said he has not gotten any assurances from senators that he’ll be confirmed. The comments from the president-elect marked the latest public praise for his embattled choice for secretary of defense after days of support behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, Trump on his Truth Social platform that the military veteran and former television anchor “is doing very well” and that “his support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe.” Asked by Welker whether he had concerns over reports of excessive drinking, Trump, who does not drink, said he’s “spoken to people that know [Hegseth] very well and they say he does not have a drinking problem.” Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing and forcefully pushed back on what he has described as unfounded attacks against him. On Thursday, he concluded his first week of meetings on Capitol Hill as he seeks to shore up support with key senators who will vote on his confirmation. Trump had told Hegseth he wants to see him fight for votes in the Senate, sources close to both men told CNN, and the continued backing is part of the reason this week while he’s held critical meetings with Republican senators. On Friday, he thanked the president-elect for his support, saying on X, “Like you, we will never back down.” Vice President-elect JD Vance, a current Ohio senator who has been talking to his colleagues in support of Hegseth, also emphasized his backing for the defense secretary pick, saying that he’s “fighting” for Hegseth because he will “fight for our troops.” “For too long, the Pentagon has been led by people who lose wars. Pete Hegseth is a man who fought in those wars. We’ve got his back,” Friday. The public support is the latest sign of Trump allies’ attempts to save Hegseth’s prospects as he faces a tough confirmation process, amid mounting allegations related to Hegseth’s workplace behavior and treatment of women, including a surfaced sexual assault allegation from 2017, which he has denied. Amid calls for more vetting, Hegseth’s name was for a background check, and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said Thursday that his client had “received the forms yesterday from the FBI, and we’re working on them right now.” Some of Trump’s allies have ramped up public pressure on senators who have so far declined to commit to supporting Hegseth. Some close to Hegseth believe that if he can survive over the next week, he will be Trump’s nominee, though he still will have to get through his confirmation hearing early next year. At the same time, many of Trump’s advisers and close allies were annoyed over reports this week that the president-elect was mulling possible replacements, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, whose vote could be among the most crucial to Hegseth’s chances. Ernst, who met with Hegseth earlier this week and plans to meet with him again next week, said on social media Friday that he should be allowed to continue the nomination process to a Senate hearing. “At a minimum, we agree that he deserves the opportunity to lay out his vision for our warfighters at a fair hearing,” she on X. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Los Angeles Lakers’ G-League guard Quincy Olivari is finalizing a shoe deal with Stephen Curry’s Under Armour Curry Brand, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. Olivari has previously described the four-time NBA champion as his “hero.” The 23-year-old Olivari, who is on a two-way deal with the team, played against Curry and Golden State Warriors in a preseason game. With his hero looking on, Olivari put on his best Curry impression, finishing the game with 22 points while making five three-pointers. Curry did not play in the game. Per Charania, Olivari’s agent, Darrell Comer of Tandem, has been in talks with Curry Brand officials in “recent weeks.” CNN has reached out to Comer and Curry Brand but did not immediately hear back. Following the October 18 game, Olivari told reporters that the 2022 NBA Finals MVP told him that he liked “his game” and then got emotional while talking about the moment. “It’s crazy because I’ve liked him since I was in sixth grade. I don’t even know what to say, man,” Olivari said. “That’s my favorite player ever. … I had his jersey. He signed it twice. I used to sleep under that jersey. I just want to be like him so bad.” Lakers rookie Quincy Olivari, who cried after meeting \"hero\" Steph Curry, is signing a shoe deal with Curry Brand, per 🙌 Full circle moment 🥹 While wiping away tears, the former Xavier University player said the Warriors star gave him a signed pair of his shoes. “That meant the world to me,” he said. While Olivari has yet to appear in a regular season game with the Lakers, he has played in five games with their G-League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers, averaging 21.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The video, which was shared widely on social media and the Brazilian press, showed an officer grabbing a civilian by the shirt and walking him towards the side of a bridge. Moments later, the officer lifts the man – who appears unarmed and not applying any resistance - and pushes him over the edge. CNN has not been able to independently verify the video. The state’s public ministry said the incident was “appalling and absolutely unacceptable” in a posted Tuesday. “There is no other way to classify the images of the moment in which a military police officer throws a man from the top of a bridge,” the public ministry said, adding that in the video it is “evident that the suspect was already subdued by security agents, who had the functional duty of taking him, intact, to a police station so that the incident could be recorded.” An arrest warrant was issued for the officer, Luan Felipe Alves, who was taken into custody early Thursday, state media Agencia Brasil . He was later ordered to remain under preventive detention by Sao Paulo’s military court as investigations around the incident are conducted, Agencia Brasil added. According to , Alves told the military court his objective was to immobilize the man for evading a police approach and to throw him on the ground, not over the bridge. The man is believed to have survived the fall, and authorities are currently searching for him for questioning, . It is unclear what charges Alves may be facing but his legal team said in a statement that his arrest “demonstrates that there is an anticipation of guilt.” “The police officer is at the disposal of the courts, but the preventive detention only responded to a social outcry,” said the obtained by CNN Brasil. Alves’ legal team also told CNN Brasil his arrest does not “meet the requirements” and they are planning to request his release. The state’s military police removed several officers from their main duties, including Alves, while the incident and the officers are investigated, Agencia Brasil reports. “I have ordered the immediate removal of the police officers involved in this regrettable scene,” Secretary of Public Security of the State of Sao Paulo, Guilherme Derrite, said Tuesday in a on X, adding that the “this type of attitude” differs from the mission of the military police. The incident hit a nerve in the city where there has been growing public anger over police violence, including an incident where an off-duty policeman killed a man for allegedly stealing soap from a market, Reuters reported. A protest against police violence broke out on Thursday in Sao Paulo, where demonstrators demanded for Derrite’s resignation, according to Reuters. “We really need our voices to be heard. We need to fight more and more. We need to take to the streets to expose the police which are so violent in the state of Sao Paulo and in Brazil,” one protester told Reuters. In an interview with the general commander of the Sao Paulo Military Police Cássio Araújo de Freitas said his internal affairs division is investigating the incidents of alleged police violence. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Investigators have yet to officially confirm the origin of the bag and are taking it to be forensically tested in a lab in Queens, the source said. Detectives earlier Friday said they have “reason to believe” the person responsible for the shooting has left New York City, according to police commissioner Jessica Tisch. With the search for the shooter suspected of killing now in its third day, the widespread manhunt is expanding and officials implore the public beyond the city’s borders to help them identify the suspect by taking a closer look at the unmasked man in the surveillance images released Thursday. Tisch and Joseph Kenny, NYPD’s Chief of Detectives, sat down with CNN’s Shimon Procupecz to discuss the expanding investigation Friday. Here’s what else we’ve learned: Police in the area of Central Park where the backpack was discovered secured the area, bagged the piece of evidence and sent it, unopened, to the lab, the law enforcement official told CNN. It will not be opened until it reaches the lab. An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to CNN a backpack was found in the park but said it “still has to be processed.” Investigators are treating the discovery like a dead body, being very careful not to damage any potential evidence, a law enforcement official told CNN. The backpack along with any physical material found surrounding it, was removed by an excavator, the source said. No officers picked it up, because there may be some DNA evidence tied to the backpack or even the dirt on the ground surrounding the backpack. Investigators say the person they believe responsible for the killing “definitely planned this out.” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz on Friday that the person of interest arrived in New York City ahead of the killing. According to Kenny, there is video of the suspect about 30 minutes before showing him “walking and wandering around the hotel area before he committed this act,” he said. “He knew what time the victim was going to be walking by. He knew what hotel this conference was going to be in,” Kenny said. Investigators have so far recovered DNA evidence from items found at the scene and have turned it over to a lab for testing, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Samples sent for testing are from a water bottle, which police believe the killer purchased and may have sipped from shortly before killing Thompson, and from a cell phone found at the scene which may contain touch or skin cell DNA, the official said. NYPD investigators finished processing the items and turned the samples over to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for testing Friday, the official told CNN. The main priority for investigators is identifying the gunman, officials say. As the NYPD homicide unit works the case, the suspect’s image has been sent to every member of the department, officials told CNN. The FBI is assisting the NYPD in its investigation, a bureau spokesperson told CNN on Friday. The New York City Police Department’s video collection unit is building and canvassing for still images of the assailant’s face to load into their technology, the official said. A smiling surveillance photo depicting a hooded man –– a face mask pushed down around his neck –– may be a key clue leading police to the suspect in the fatal shooting. The image released by the New York Police Department shows a man authorities call a “person of interest wanted for questioning” in the Wednesday morning killing. He is captured in a flirtatious moment with a female employee at a hostel on New York’s Upper West Side where he had been staying, a law enforcement official told CNN. “He’s been traveling and walking around the streets of New York City largely in a mask, with his face covered,” Tisch said. “We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down.” The employee asked the man to lower his face mask, which is when the photos released by authorities on Thursday were captured, the offi cial said. “He lowers the mask, and gives that big smile,” CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller said. “That little flirtation between the two of them, in some good-humored way, actually yielded what is so far the most significant clue to identifying him.” The hostel apologized for the presence of law enforcement and media in the area on a flyer posted inside the building Thursday night, a photo obtained by CNN shows. “The well-being of our guests, volunteers, staff and all those at our property is our top priority, and our team is cooperating with the authorities who are handling the matter,” the flyer reads. Niki Dilley, a 23-year-old tourist from New Zealand, checked into the hostel on Tuesday. Dilley is traveling with a friend and staying in a four-person room on the fourth floor. He said he never saw the person of interest, adding many people are going in and out of the building all the time. Dilley saw one police officer on Wednesday night but was not interviewed. “It’s made for an interesting week,” he said, but has noticed no mass exodus of guests as a result. “It’s scary, but also cool,” he said of staying at the hostel. “We are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, can not comment at this time,” a spokesperson for the hostel previously told CNN. Along with photos from the hostel, investigators continue to examine physical evidence including the believed to have been dropped by the suspect when he fled the shooting scene – first on foot, then by bike – as well as recovered ammunition with written on them, sources told CNN. Kenny told reporters the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, according to the Associated Press. Authorities also have pieced together more about how and when the suspect got to New York City. Now, the biggest challenge for the NYPD is tracing the movements of one person in a city populated with more than 8 million people, Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, told CNN Thursday. In the wake of the brazen attack, UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare, has laid out security plans for employees. “We’re ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of our employees,” said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group in an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by CNN. The health insurance company is fully cooperating with law enforcement as the manhunt continues, the email said. “Several support mechanisms” are being put in place for employees, Witty said. “We have increased security at our campuses in Minnesota, in addition to sites in Washington, D.C., and New York City areas.” No visitors are allowed on administrative campuses through the end of the week, Witty added. Video of the –– carried out in full view of pedestrians in the busy Manhattan area –– helped investigators determine the suspect’s first moves after the shooting, police said. The masked gunman waited for Thompson outside the Hilton Midtown shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday then before fleeing through an alleyway and getting on an electric bike. He was last seen at 6:48 a.m. headed into Central Park, New York police said. , who lived in Minnesota and was on his way to the hotel to attend his company’s annual investor conference, was pronounced dead less than half an hour later. New details are now emerging about the suspect’s movements in the days leading up to the shooting. The suspected gunman traveled on , law enforcement sources told CNN. Authorities do not know whether the suspect boarded in Atlanta or elsewhere, sources said. The Atlanta Police Department will provide assistance to the NYPD as needed in the investigation, department officials . NYPD detectives are expected to come to Atlanta to help further the investigation into the gunman, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. Police believe the assailant arrived at New York City’s Port Authority bus terminal on November 24 – 10 days before the shooting – then checked into the Upper West Side hostel, a law enforcement official said. After that, he appears to have moved around the city, the official said. The suspected shooter appeared to wear a mask throughout most of his stay at the hostel, law enforcement sources told CNN. He was housed in a multi-person room with two other males, one source said. The suspect checked out of the hostel on November 29 and checked back in on November 30, law enforcement sources told CNN. He paid the establishment in cash, according to one source –– checking into the hostel using a fake New Jersey driver’s license, a law enforcement official previously told CNN. A shell casing recovered from one of the bullets fired at Thompson had the word “depose” written on it, while “delay” was written on a live round that was ejected when the shooter appeared to be clearing a jam, law enforcement sources told CNN on Thursday. Police are exploring whether the words found indicate a motive, pointing to a popular phrase in the insurance industry: “delay, deny, defend.” Police are still trying to determine where the suspect got the e-bike, however investigators are developing clues from the believed to have been dropped by the gunman when he fled the shooting scene. A fingerprint was lifted from the water bottle, a law enforcement official told CNN. The print, however, is smudged making it less conclusive, the official said. The phone could yield fingerprints, DNA and –– if police technicians can unlock the phone –– other clues to the suspect’s identity, investigators said. Even a disposable burner phone might yield clues about communications and searches before the shooting. Police on Thursday afternoon were still trying to access that phone, a law enforcement official said. Authorities have not found the gunman’s bike, weapon or backpack. The suspect could have taken steps after fleeing to Central Park to evade detection, like changing into a different set of clothes, McCabe said. Through Wednesday, police deployed mobile field forces to conduct a grid search, looking through garbage cans, dumpsters and bushes in an extensive search for a missing gray backpack, which the assailant was seen wearing during the shooting, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. Police initiated the search after detectives reviewed security footage of the suspect no longer wearing the backpack after leaving .

She amassed an eye-wateringly valuable portfolio of luxury homes, hotels and commercial properties all over the country and abroad – allegedly by effectively turning a major bank into her own personal ATM. On Tuesday, the 68-year-old lost her appeal against the death sentence for masterminding one of the biggest frauds in global history, in which billions vanished from Vietnam’s financial system. She had been put on death row by a Ho Chi Minh City court in April for embezzling more than $12 billion – an amount equivalent to roughly 3% of Vietnam’s entire economy. The scale of the fraud rattled confidence in an economy which hopes to woo foreign investors away from competitors such as neighboring China, which could find itself hobbled by US tariffs under the second Donald Trump administration. There is, however, a small glimmer of a reprieve for Lan – if she can afford it. Her death sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment if she repays three-quarters of what she earned via the fraud, judges said in their ruling, state-run VnExpress International reported. So, can she find $9 billion to spare, to save her life? Born to a modest Sino-Vietnamese family in 1956, Lan started out selling cosmetics with her mother at Ho Chi Minh City’s oldest market, according to local and state media reports. She steadily grew small businesses, but her wealth skyrocketed after she met Hong Kong investor Eric Chu. She set up real-estate company Van Thinh Phat in 1992, the year she married Chu. By 2011, Lan was already a powerful yet low-profile business figure in Ho Chi Minh City. That year, she became involved in the merger of the struggling Saigon Joint Commercial Bank with two other lenders, in a deal coordinated by Vietnam’s central bank. She was well on her way to riches, high status and, eventually, infamy. More than a decade later, the manipulation of the banking system came to the fore when Vietnam’s property bubble burst and bad loans started stacking up as multiple Lan-linked businesses suffered financially during the Covid-19 pandemic, Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the Vietnam Studies Programme of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, told CNN. Lan’s arrest in October 2022 sparked a week-long run on Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB), then the nation’s fifth-largest lender, over suspicions of its ties with Lan’s alleged financial crimes. Her arrest set off a ticking bomb that reverberated across the business and political elites which became “too big to not recognize,” Giang said. On paper, Lan owned 5% of SCB’s shares, the upper limit allowed under Vietnamese law. But prosecutors accuse her of indirectly owning 91.5% of the bank, according to of the trial. Prosecutors also alleged she bribed banking regulators and officials to cover her tracks. Investigators her and dozens of accomplices of taking loans and cash through a web of thousands of shell companies over more than a decade – siphoning off what amounts to a total of $44 billion. By comparison, Malaysia’s long-running that began in 2009, described as one of the world’s biggest financial crimes, involved the looting of about $4.5 billion. Even crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried’s $8 billion fraud is dwarfed by Lan’s case. The sheer scale of the criminality meant the case was split into two trials. Among the total losses, $12 billion was ruled to have been embezzled, for which Lan was sentenced to death. She was tried alongside 85 others, including former central bankers and government officials, as well as previous SCB executives. Lan was also handed a life sentence in a separate trial in October after being found guilty of obtaining property by fraud, money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfers, VnExpress International misappropriating roughly $27 billion. “When you have corruption of this scale, it signals that things are bad in the country because it means legislation is not good, supervision is not good and the financial system is actually quite vulnerable,” Giang said. Giang said Lan would likely not be executed immediately, adding her lawyers would probably request a review of the case or apply for a presidential pardon. But the court’s harsh sentencing shows the authorities’ commitment to making Vietnam more transparent and better placed to attract foreign investment, especially if the US-China trade war reignites, he added. Lan, for her part, has repeatedly made pleas for mercy. During a trial in October, Lan told the court that she never intended to commit fraud but was prepared to take responsibility, according to a VnExpress International . “I consider this my destiny,” Lan was quoted as saying. Upholding the death sentence this week, the appeal court’s judges said Lan’s crimes caused grave consequences, and there are no mitigating circumstances to reduce her sentence, VnExpress International The real estate mogul’s downfall was stunning for the gargantuan scale of the fraud, rattling a country which has long projected an image of authoritarian stability. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party (CPV) has led the country of nearly 100 million people since it won the Vietnam War in 1975, priding itself on longevity, national unity and party loyalty. The country transitioned away from a state-run economy towards a more market-oriented one in a series of reforms called “Doi Moi” in 1986, welcoming private businesses and foreign investors. Now, Vietnam depends on manufacturing exports and foreign investment, and its leaders have been tightening the party’s grip on power by clamping down not only on dissent but also on corruption. Former CPV secretary general Nguyen Phu Trong launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign – dubbed the “blazing furnace” – in 2016, which has led to the indictments of thousands of people, including party top brass. Business and politics have long been intricately entwined in Vietnam. In 2023, the country ranked 83rd out of 180 countries in . And the country’s opaque media-political ecosystem means access to information is tightly controlled. Lan’s financial crimes have exposed just how shaky the nation’s financial system truly is, Zachary Abuza, a professor in Southeast Asian politics and security issues at the National War College in Washington, told CNN. “In Vietnam, the land is controlled by the state. There’s no way she could have done what she did… without more official connivance,” Abuza said. Her trial, which began in March, has played out publicly in state media, and parts of it were live-streamed outside the court in Ho Chi Minh City, deliberately designed to show the public that the government is following through on its crackdown. But bank regulators and financial ministers are poorly paid and notoriously corrupt, making them arguably culpable for allowing the fraud to snowball, Abuza added. “Vietnamese regulators were absolutely shocked at the extent and investigators were flabbergasted by the extent of the corruption,” Abuza said. “But they did everything they could to make this case about her and have really tried not to draw lines linking her to communist party officials.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

Scientists at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History have peered beneath the wrappings of ancient Egyptian mummified human remains to uncover new details about their identities and how they were prepared for the afterlife — all without removing a single piece of linen. In September, staff members rolled 26 of the mummies on display at the museum on specially built carts to the parking lot to be put through a mobile CT scanner. The nondestructive technology resulted in thousands of X-rays of the mummies and their coffins. When stacked together, the X-rays created 3D images that revealed the skeletons and artifacts inside. The new insights are helping to shed light on Egyptians’ mortuary practices more than 3,000 years ago as well as what they thought was important to carry into the afterlife. While the scans took about four days to complete, the processing and analysis of the 3D renderings may take up to three years, said JP Brown, senior conservator of anthropology at the museum. In addition to providing insights about the best methods to preserve the mummies for generations, the scans also offer a chance to understand the individuality and personal details of each mummified Egyptian in a respectful way. “From an archaeological perspective, it is incredibly rare that you get to investigate or view history from the perspective of a single individual,” said Stacy Drake, human remains collections manager at the Field Museum. “This is a really great way for us to look at who these people were — not just the stuff that they made and the stories that we have concocted about them, but the actual individuals that were living at this time.” “ ” is one of the most popular exhibits at the museum and includes a three-story replica of a type of tomb called a . The tomb’s burial chambers, dated to 2400 BC, contain 23 human mummies and more than 30 animal mummies. Ancient Egyptians believed that the soul remained inside the body after death, so embalmers mummified bodies to preserve the spirit for the afterlife, according to Field Museum scientists. The spiritual and biological ritual of mummification could take 70 days, including removing internal organs except for the heart because it was thought to be the soul’s home. Embalmers used salt to dry the bodies, then wrapped them in linens, sometimes writing prayers or including protective amulets. A ceremonial burial would be the final step to send the mummified person on to the afterlife. Any internal organs removed during the process were typically placed in canopic jars, each featuring an iconographic lid with one of the four sons of the to protect each organ. Imsety was the human-headed god who protected the liver, while Hapy had the head of a baboon and protected the lungs. Jackal-headed Duamutef protected the stomach, and falcon-headed Qebehsenuef watched over the intestines. Previous CT scans revealed that some embalmers chose to make packets for the organs and reinsert them within the mummies. Within the packets were wax statues of the sons of Horus responsible for protecting the organs. The statues helped the museum scientists identify the organs in each packet, Brown said. Ancient Egyptians viewed the afterlife in a similar way to how modern people think about retirement savings, according to Brown. “It’s something you prepare for, put money aside for all the way through your life and hope you’ve got enough at the end to really enjoy yourself,” he said. “You want to be living your best afterlife.” Not every ancient Egyptian was mummified, but the restricted practice apparently was common among the upper middle class and those of high status, Brown said. Burials for pharaohs, the rulers of ancient Egypt, were comparable to the status of a top-of-the-line automobile. Meanwhile, Lady Chenet-aa, one of the museum’s most popular mummified individuals, had a burial on the scale of a high-end luxury car, Brown said. Lady Chenet-aa lived about 3,000 years ago during the 22nd Dynasty in Egypt. The new scans helped scientists estimate that the high-status woman died in her late 30s to early 40s, while wear on her teeth shows that the food she ate contained grains of sand rough on the enamel. Stuffing was placed in her trachea to ensure her neck wouldn’t collapse, and artificial eyes were placed in her eye sockets to guarantee she had them in the afterlife, Drake said. “The additions are very literal,” Brown said. “If you want eyes, then there needs to be physical eyes, or at least some physical allusion to eyes. They’ll put a prosthetic in to make sure that you’ve got everything you need when you go to the afterlife.” Lady Chenet-aa was wrapped in expensive layers of linen before being placed in a decorated cartonnage coffin, or a papier-mâché-like funeral box. But the biggest mystery about the Egyptian was how she was placed in the box in the first place. There were no visible seams, and only a tiny opening at the feet — not wide enough to accommodate sliding the body into the box. The new scans revealed the cartonnage’s underside for the first time, showing that the box was essentially laced shut at the back before being plastered over to create a seamless aesthetic, Brown said. The team said that embalmers stood the mummy upright and that the cartonnage was softened with humidity to make it flexible so they could closely mold it around the body. A slit was cut at the back of the cartonnage so the body could be placed inside, and then it was closed up and laced shut. While a CT scan can’t detect colors, it revealed the artistic designs etched into the top of the cartonnage, including indents for the knees. The team also took a closer look at Harwa, a mummified individual who lived around 3,000 years ago and was a granary’s doorkeeper. Analysis of scans shows he was in his early to mid-40s when he died. From all appearances, he had a high social status and lived a comfortable life. “We started looking at these two individuals primarily just to see a better idea of age and sex and any obvious pathologies or things we might see,” Drake said. “One thing that we are seeing is pretty extensive wear on their teeth because they’re living next to the desert, and there’s going to be a lot of sand in their food, or they’re using stone to grind their food. But we’re not seeing a lot of wear on the body for these two individuals in particular who were higher status and likely not conducting a lot of physical labor.” The CT scans help scientists understand any chronic conditions individuals may have had, but the technology also aids in correcting cases of mistaken identity. While Harwa and Lady Chenet-aa both clearly had coffins made just for them, not every mummified individual was as fortunate. One of the coffins is etched with hieroglyphics that indicate a priest was buried inside, but the individual was a 14-year-old boy much smaller than the coffin. “We know that sometimes people really wanted to be mummified but didn’t necessarily always have the best means to do so,” Drake said. “You could get a discount coffin by borrowing or using someone else’s.” In the late 19th century as archaeologists uncovered mummies in Egypt’s deserts, they would unwrap them to see what they could learn. Now, the emphasis is on protecting mummified individuals to help them last for thousands of more years, Brown said. Today, practices around mummified individuals have shifted to show respect for how human remains are presented and displayed in museum settings, Drake said. The Field Museum also had conversations with Egyptian representatives about returning the mummies to Egypt, but those officials requested that the mummies remain on display at the Chicago museum, she said. “The Field Museum is unaware of any formal conversations with Egyptian officials regarding the mummified remains in our care,” according to a statement from the museum. “The previous statement regarding such conversations was anecdotal and cannot be supported by Museum records or current staff.” Harwa’s adventurous afterlife is one example of how things have changed. In 1939, he became the first mummified person to fly on an airplane, and he was taken to a Broadway show upon his arrival in New York City. On display at the New York World’s Fair for two years, he then returned to the Field Museum after getting lost in the luggage and being sent to San Francisco. “It’s maybe not what we would consider ethical anymore,” Drake said. “One of the big things for these ancient Egyptian individuals is how you continue to live after death. And that is part of his story and his journey.” The museum wants to convey the idea that mummies are people, rather than art objects, Brown said. “We are trying to understand them as people so that we can share those stories and insights with the general public to kind of rehumanize and shift the narratives to be more respectful and give some more dignity to these mummified individuals,” Drake said.

Detectives also from the scene of the shooting and turned it over to a lab for testing, another official said earlier Friday. • Investigators have “reason to believe” the shooting , as he was seen on video entering a bus station after the killing and never leaving, the city’s chief of detectives told CNN. Officials believe the gunman waiting for Thompson outside a conference at a hotel. • Authorities have sifted through hours of surveillance footage in their investigation, and an image of the suspect at an Upper West Side hostel clerk finally that police are now spreading widely in hopes of identifying the man. The FBI is assisting in the investigation into the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive by offering a new reward of up to $50,000 for “information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible.” The increased reward comes days after the NYPD Crime Stoppers announced a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible. The FBI has also released a “seeking information” poster featuring images of the suspect. “We are seeking the public’s help in identifying the unknown suspect responsible for the homicide,” . Anyone with information about this case is asked to contact the FBI’s tipline or the New York City Police Department’s tipline. They may also contact their or submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov, the FBI said. New York Police Department investigators appear to be homing in on the possible identity of the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO in Manhattan, two people briefed on the investigation said. Investigators now are working to track the possible whereabouts of the suspect, using thousands of investigative leads including the use of facial recognition technology and examining traces of DNA that could help find the killer, the people briefed on the probe said. Investigators are still working to verify the information and aren’t yet certain they know the identity of the suspect. Investigators are looking into the possibility that the gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson may have used what is known as a veterinary gun, a larger firearm used on farms and ranches, Joseph Kenny, New York Police Department chief of detectives, told The New York Times. “If an animal has to get put down, the animal can be shot without” the weapon causing a large noise, Kenny said. CNN has reached out to the NYPD for additional context. The veterinary gun is based on the design of a welrod that, even dating back to the British during World War II, was an assassin’s weapon, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller explained. “It’s practically silent. It’s a significant round. It’s a 9 millimeter round. And it’s meant for close-up killing. It’s meant for vets to kill an animal by shooting it in the head or somewhere, you know, that’s going to be fatal. But it would work the exact same way on humans, very effectively and extraordinarily quietly,” Miller said said. New details are emerging in the case of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s death, as a manhunt for the person of interest involved in the fatal shooting is on its third day. Authorities yet have a name for the suspect at this time, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. But police consider a suspect may have provided a significant clue as he lowered his mask during a flirtatious moment with a New York hostel clerk, CNN’s chief law enforcement analyst reported Thursday. Investigators have that they believe belonged to the suspect. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition discovered by detectives investigating the shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, one word on each of three bullets, . CNN previously reported that two of the words, had been found on a shell casing and a live round at the scene of the killing of health care executive Brian Thompson early Wednesday morning. Detectives are examining the ammunition along with other physical evidence, including a burner phone and a water bottle found nearby, sources said. Police are exploring whether the words , since they are similar to a phrase commonly used to describe insurance company tactics: “Delay, deny, defend.” The phrase is also the title of a book critical of the industry. Investigators have yet to determine the shooter’s identity and motive, but in an interview with NBC, Thompson’s widow, Paulette, told the network that “there had been some threats” against her husband, potentially related to “a lack of coverage … I don’t know the details.” Thompson’s killing has prompted the venting of rage and frustration at the nation’s complex health insurance industry online, with social media users sharing their stories of denied medical claims. Investigators are treating a backpack found in New York City’s Central Park like a dead body, being very careful not to damage any potential evidence, a law enforcement official told CNN. The backpack was removed by an excavator along with any physical material found surrounding it, the source said. No officers picked it up to preserve potential DNA evidence tied to the backpack or even the dirt on the ground surrounding it. Forensic investigators at a police lab in Queens will go through the contents of the bag slowly and deliberately and should have everything out of it by tomorrow. They will examine not only the contents of the bag but the bag itself, which may have sweat or other evidence of the shooter, the source said. While this is happening, investigators are still searching for the suspect’s name. They believe he traveled to the city by bus and are in the process of ruling out a tip that the shooter left by plane. Police have different leads and are currently going through them all. In addition to video canvassing, they are requesting bus manifests to see if there could be any identifying clues. They have also reached out to the security team of UnitedHealthcare to get their complied person of interest list, looking for people that have been publicly vocal with complaints against the company, according to the source. They are asking about anyone who has used any vitriolic language and made threats, either on social media or through attendance at public demonstrations. Most people on the list have already been dismissed through social media searches, the law enforcement source said. The rest are being looked into for any possible ties. All the work being done is indicative of the massive undertaking this process is, the source said. The mandate is to continue to build a video timeline of every day the suspect was in the city. There is still no common area where he has gone multiple times. Identifying the suspect is critical and multiple law enforcement agencies are offering to help in the search once an ID is made, the source added. A backpack found in Central Park on Friday night may be a turning point in the investigation into the suspected gunman, but the area around the bag may also provide important evidence, according to Josh Skule, former FBI Executive Assistant Director for Intelligence. “The area around the backpack will be significant. They’re going to process that. They’re going to look to see — can they match a shoe print? Is there some other evidence the suspect left behind? You can never have too much evidence in a prosecution in a case of this magnitude,” Skule told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. While the contents of the backpack will be critical, the bag may also carry DNA, hair and other fibers that could be used as evidence, he added. NYPD investigators found a backpack in Central Park that they believe belonged to the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators have yet to officially confirm the origin of the bag and are taking it to be forensically tested in a lab in Queens, the source said. The bag was found in a second sweep of the park Friday evening, between some boulders just south of the park’s carousel, the source said. Police secured the area, bagged the piece of evidence and sent it — unopened — to the lab, the source said. It will not be opened until it reaches the lab. An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to CNN that a backpack was found in the park but said it “still has to be processed.” New York City Police had to sift through a substantial amount of video surveillance footage to obtain an image of the person of interest in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson without a mask. “He’s been traveling and walking around the streets of New York City largely in a mask, with his face covered. We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down,” New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in an interview with CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz. The image, released by police on Thursday, shows the person smiling at an employee at a hostel on New York’s Upper West Side, where he had been staying, a law enforcement official previously told CNN. Tisch said the NYPD has access to “tens of thousands of cameras” around the city, something she said has been “huge” in the investigation. Some of those cameras are installed by NYPD on light poles and others were put up by surrounding buildings. “Our detectives have done just the most extraordinary job in this case doing a city-wide camera canvas for this person,” Tisch said. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny added, “We could have detectives sit in front of a monitor looking at video for eight hours to come up with an eight second clip.” The person of interest involved in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO “definitely planned this out,” investigators say. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz on Friday that the person of interest arrived in New York City ahead of the fatal incident, and there is video of him about 30 minutes before, “walking and wandering around the hotel area before he committed this act.” “He knew what time the victim was going to be walking by. He knew what hotel this conference was going to be in,” Kenny said. The Atlanta Police Department confirmed Friday that it is working with the NYPD as part of the investigation into the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. “As of this afternoon, on December 6, 2024, the Atlanta Police Department was contacted by NYPD and will now be providing assistance as needed. The NYPD is the lead agency in this investigation so please direct all questions to their Public Affairs Office. The Atlanta Police Department will not be able to provide interviews or answer any questions regarding this investigation.” CNN previously reported investigators believe a bus that the suspected gunman traveled on to New York originated in Atlanta. The FBI is also assisting the NYPD in its investigation, a bureau spokesperson told CNN on Friday. New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told CNN Friday that authorities have “a huge amount of evidence” in the killing of . “We already have lots of forensic evidence, fingerprints, DNA evidence,” she pointed, adding there’s also a “massive camera canvass” of the suspected shooter’s movements through the city. “We are right now processing a tremendous amount of evidence in this case,” Tisch said. Authorities do not yet have a name for the suspect at this time, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. Investigators have a “reason to believe” the person of interest in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO has left New York City, according to police commissioner Jessica Tisch. She told CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz that police released photos of the person not wearing a mask on Thursday because they want a “wider audience to see the picture outside of New York City.” This is the first interview with top police officials since the shooting happened. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said officers are conducting a “very, very extensive video canvas.” They are reviewing footage from around the Hilton hotel, where the shooting occurred, to uptown Manhattan. He said the suspected gunman rode on a bike from the shooting scene to Central Park. The person then exited the park around 77th Street, still with the bike, Kenny said. Footage later shows him walking at 86th Street and Columbus Avenue, according to Kenny, before he gets in a cab that takes him to a Port Authority bus station near 178th Street and Broadway. “Those buses are interstate buses. That’s why we believe he may have left New York City,” he said, adding that police are working to figure out which bus the person may have gotten on. Kenny said authorities have video of the suspect entering the station, but “we don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” he later added. The various pieces of evidence being uncovered by police in the case of the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO are crucial not only for finding the gunman — but also for his prosecution. “The DNA evidence is important. Everything is for courtroom testimony so we can link him to the crime,” retired NYPD Detective Michael Alcazar told CNN on Friday. Once police apprehend the person of interest they are looking for, the key is to be able to link him to the evidence, he said. Investigators have , a believed to have been dropped by the suspect when he fled the shooting scene, as well as ammunition with written on them left at the scene of the crime, sources told CNN. A medical examiner is testing for possible DNA evidence left on some of those items, a senior law enforcement official said earlier. The NYPD also released new images of the person of interest without a mask at the hostel where they believe he was staying at before the shooting. “Our DNA, our fingerprints are left everywhere — It could be on the countertop of that hostel, so as prepared as you think you might be, there’s mistakes that people make all the time and law enforcement relies on that,” Alcazar said. Former FBI criminal profiler Candice Long believes the suspected gunman in the rode to New York on a Greyhound bus so he could avoid encountering tight airport security while carrying a gun. “This is a smart guy. This has been very well planned out,” Long said on “CNN Newsroom” Friday morning. “Being on a bus, he would be inconspicuous and would not have to go through all the problems that would arise at an airport with a gun.” But the thing he didn’t account for, Long said, was by a clerk at his hostel — a moment that ultimately gave investigators crucial surveillance footage of his face. “She caught him off guard, and that could be his undoing,” Long said, later noting: “The pressure is on because of that picture.” When asked whether she believes the suspect is still in New York City, Long said, “It’s hard to say.” “It’s possible. I mean, you can get lost in New York for years.” The hostel where police believe the person of interest in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was staying has posted a notice to other guests, stating that it is cooperating with police in the investigation. A photo of the notice, posted on one of the internal doors of the hostel, was provided to CNN by Niki Dilley, a 23-year-old tourist from New Zealand who checked in on Tuesday. Dilley, who is traveling with a friend, is staying in a four-person room on the fourth floor. He said he never saw the person of interest, adding that many people are going in and out of the building all the time. He saw one police officer on Wednesday night but was not interviewed. “It’s made for an interesting week,” he said. Dilly said he’s not noticed any mass exodus. He saw a school group of about 25 people, small groups and several individuals. “We are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, can not comment at this time,” a spokesperson for HI USA previously told CNN. The man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson had carefully planned his movements around the city, but several key mistakes may eventually lead investigators to identify him, former FBI agent Daniel Brunner told CNN. “I think what he was trying to do was trying to be a professional. He thought that he was being professional by paying the cash and (using the fake) ID,” Brunner said on “CNN News Central.” But removing his mask during a flirtatious exchange with the hostel clerk was “one of his biggest mistakes,” Brunner said. It allowed investigators to get the clearest image of his face so far. Wearing a backpack that could be traced back to him and staying at a high-traffic hostel could also work against him, he added. “These different mistakes and staying at a hostel where he had roommates and other people seeing him come and go — those are mistakes that will eventually lead to his capture,” Brunner said. Investigators mapping the suspect’s movements across New York City will be aided by the “immense amount of surveillance” provided by the city’s web of cameras, Brunner said. “When he leaves New York City, that’s where it becomes a much bigger puzzle piece in trying to put together his movements,” he added. Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, addressed employees in an internal video message Thursday, describing the circumstances of Brian Thompson’s death as “profoundly shocking and disturbing.” “I want to reiterate just how immeasurably sad the tragic passing of Brian really is to his family, to his friends, to all of his work colleagues and, frankly, to the American health care industry within which Brian was an innovator and somebody who endlessly put patient interests first to try and improve health care for everybody,” Witty said in the video obtained by CNN. Witty acknowledged that employees are “nervous around security and safety” and detailed heightened security measures the company is implementing at its facilities nationwide, including security checks before people enter campuses. Employees are encouraged to reach out to internal support programs if they are feeling anxious or upset or have recommendations on where security could be tightened, he said. An image of the suspected gunman in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was sent to every member of the NYPD as investigators’ top priority has become identifying the suspect, a law enforcement official told CNN. The department’s video collection unit is canvassing, trying to find more still images of the assailant’s face to load into its facial recognition technology, the official said. The precinct’s detectives and the homicide unit are working the case, according to the official. Police are operating under the idea that once the shooter is identified, he can be apprehended anywhere. New York City’s mayor is confident that police will find the person who killed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in Manhattan on Wednesday, as the manhunt stretches into its third day. “We’re seeing good old fashioned police work here,” Mayor Eric Adams told NY1 on Friday, adding that investigators are “on the right track.” He reiterated that the shooting was “not a random act of violence” and “we are on the pathway to bring this person to justice that definitely gives New Yorkers a small piece of mind that it was targeted.” Because of that police work, Adams told CNBC’s Squawk Box that detectives have uncovered “a lot of new information,” but wouldn’t give specific details while the investigation is ongoing. In another interview Friday with radio show 1010 WINS, Adams pointed out the significance of new images police released on Thursday of the person of interest, where he is not wearing a mask. “To get that visual was extremely difficult to do,” Adams told the radio show. “Because of the cameras we have in the city, we were able to use various angles and shots to get the still photo that we have, and we know that it was extremely important to have the level of technology and video surveillance we have in this city,” he later added. Detectives investigating the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive have recovered possible DNA evidence from items found at the scene and have now turned it over to a lab for testing, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The swab samples are from a water bottle, which police believe the killer purchased and may have sipped from shortly before killing Brian Thompson, and from a cell phone found at the scene, which may contain touch or skin cell DNA if the killer handled it, the official said. The official told CNN that NYPD investigators finished processing the items and turned the samples over to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for testing Friday. The early morning killing of a top health insurance executive in midtown Manhattan Wednesday has unleashed a flurry of rage and frustration from social media users over denials of their medical claims, a public display of Americans’ pent-up anger at the nation’s complex health insurance industry. In one stark example, a Facebook post by UnitedHealth Group expressing sadness about UnitedHealthcare CEO ’s death received 62,000 reactions — 57,000 of them laughing emojis. UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, the division that Thompson ran. A source told CNN that there were against UnitedHealth Group, although Thompson’s name was not mentioned. Almost immediately after news broke that Thompson had been killed, social media users began posting about their frustrations with UnitedHealthcare and other insurance companies. UnitedHealthcare “denied my surgery two days before it was scheduled. I was in the hospital finance office in tears (when I was supposed to be at the hospital doing pre-op stuff),” one user wrote in an X post that received more than 70,000 likes. “My mother was flying out to see me. My surgeon spent a day and a half pleading my case to United when she probably should have been taking care of her other patients,” she added, before saying the surgery ended up going ahead but calling the process “torture.” “My breast cancer surgery was denied” by a different insurance company, another X user posted. “Breast cancer. She asked me ‘well, is it an emergency?’ I don’t know- it’s (f***ing) cancer. What do you think? I had to appeal and luckily it went through. Evil to do that to people,” she said. Their stories could not be independently verified by CNN. TikTokker and anesthesiologist Brian Schmutzler said in a video that the shooting was “obviously tragic for him, tragic for his family, but this brought up some bigger issues.” “From my perspective, we have a bigger issue with the insurance companies in general, who, essentially, it’s their job to make money, not to actually pay for health care,” he said. Smiling photos showing a man police are calling a person of interest in the killing of a healthcare executive in New York City may have provided a “significant clue” in identifying the shooting suspect, said John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. The NYPD released photos of surveillance footage on Thursday showing a man who police believe is the suspect involved in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The still images show the man smiling with his mask down. The images show a moment of flirting between the man and a female employee at a hostel on New York’s Upper West Side where he had checked in, a law enforcement official told CNN. As the man chats with the clerk, the woman asks the suspect to lower his face mask, which is when the photos released by authorities on Thursday were captured, the official told CNN. “He lowers the mask, and gives that big smile,” Miller said. “That little flirtation between the two of them, in some good-humored way, actually yielded what is so far the most significant clue to identifying him,” Miller said. Police are using video surveillance to piece together the alleged gunman’s movements before, during and after of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Hegseth’s name has been submitted to the FBI , his attorney told CNN, as some lawmakers call for more vetting. Hegseth met with GOP senators this week and has . Elon Musk poured at least $260 million into efforts to reelect Trump, new filings show — making him of a presidential campaign. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were also on Capitol Hill yesterday about Trump’s new agency, the (DOGE). Trump is v to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral and meet with French President Emmanuel Macron. It is his first overseas trip since being elected in November to a second term. President-elect Donald Trump called President Joe Biden last week to wish Biden a happy Thanksgiving, a White House official told CNN. The official did not provide additional information on the substance of the call, which was first reported by . The call marks the pair’s first known interaction since Biden hosted Trump for a meeting in the Oval Office on November 13. CNN has reached out to Trump’s team for comment. In an interview with NBC News on Friday, President-elect Donald Trump , his choice to lead the Department of Defense, and said he does not believe Hegseth has a drinking problem following reports of excessive drinking. Trump expressed optimism about Hegseth’s chances to get confirmed in the Senate following his supportive post on social media earlier on Friday, even as he acknowledged “people were a little bit concerned” after reports about his defense secretary pick’s drinking and claims of sexual misconduct. “Looks like Pete is doing well now. I mean, people were a little bit concerned,” he said. “He’s a young guy with a tremendous track record. Actually, went to Princeton and went to Harvard. He was a good student at both, but he loves the military, and I think people are starting to see it. So, we’ll be working on his nomination, along with a lot of others.” When asked if he has confidence in Hegseth’s chances of being confirmed, Trump said, “Yes I do, I really do.” Trump said he’s spoken to senators about Hegseth, who told him his defense secretary pick is “fantastic,” but said he has not gotten any assurances from senators that Hegseth will pass confirmation. When asked about his feelings on the reports of Hegseth’s drinking, Trump, who himself does not drink, said he’s spoken to people close to Hegseth who have told him he doesn’t have a drinking problem. “I’ve spoken to people that know him very well and they say he does not have a drinking problem,” Trump said. NBC aired a clip of the interview on Friday. The full interview is scheduled to air on Sunday on Meet the Press. Trump’s team sent out a fundraising email Friday touting his support of Hegseth. “President Trump proudly stands with Pete Hegseth. Pete will join the most Patriotic cabinet in American history - promises made, PROMISES KEPT!,” the email says, adding, “But none of this would’ve been possible without your support.” While President-elect Donald Trump’s controversial pick for defense secretary, , is beginning the process to undergo , the intensive review may not provide the answers that either Democrats or Republicans are seeking. That’s because a nominee doesn’t “pass” a background check, and the FBI doesn’t approve applicants. Instead, the FBI’s investigative files on nominees are sent to the White House, which makes the final decision on whether they can hold the positions to which the president appointed them. FBI background checks have been lightning rods during previous contentious confirmation fights. After sexual misconduct allegations nearly tanked Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination in 2018, for example, Democrats said the FBI background investigation was politically constrained and did not follow proper procedures. Hegseth’s confirmation has been in jeopardy amid a series of allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct, which he has denied. As calls for additional vetting have mounted, Hegseth’s attorney told CNN this week that his name has been submitted to the FBI for the background check. The FBI is gearing up to conduct detailed background checks on thousands of appointees for Trump’s incoming administration. While the president-elect has been moving quickly to name his Cabinet and key administrative picks, his use of the FBI system had been in question until the Trump transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department in recent days. Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst said in a social media post on Friday that she believes Pete Hegseth, president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, should be allowed to continue the nomination process to a Senate hearing amid concerns surrounding his nomination over Ernst, who had met with Hegseth earlier this week, said she plans to meet with him again next week. “Pete Hegseth and I will continue our constructive conversations as we move forward together in this process. We plan to meet again next week. At a minimum, we agree that he deserves the opportunity to lay out his vision for our warfighters at a fair hearing,” in the social media post. Hegseth met with several Republican senators on Capitol Hill over the past week as he seeks to rally support for his nomination. Earlier on Friday, Trump said in a social media post despite his embattled nomination. President-elect is to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, his first overseas trip since his election in November to a second term in office. Trump’s team had been in discussions for days with French President Emmanuel Macron’s office regarding the visit, and the US president-elect was invited by the French government to attend the reopening, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. “President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Monday. “It will be a very special day for all!” Trump and Macron worked together closely throughout the first Trump administration, with their relationship being described as somewhat of a “bromance,” despite at times appearing openly hostile toward one another. Macron was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump after he became just the second US president to win a nonconsecutive term, writing on X: “Congratulations, President . Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” Later that evening, Trump and Macron spoke by phone, Macron’s office said. As soon as the invitation was received, Trump told his team he wanted to attend as he has long held a fascination with Notre Dame, which was severely damaged by a fire in 2019. At the time, Trump had watched footage of the fire burning while aboard Air Force One, commenting on social media: “So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!” A US appeals court upheld a law that in the United States. The court denied TikTok’s argument that the law was unconstitutional and the judges found that the law does not “contravene the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,” nor does it “violate the Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws.” Learn more in the video below: Vice President-elect JD Vance said Friday he believes Kash Patel, , is in a “very good spot” for his nomination, and that he doesn’t know whether he will be joining Patel on Capitol Hill early next week, as he is expected to meet with senators. “I don’t know what I’ll be doing next week. We’re fully behind Kash’s nomination, and I’m not even sure if— I’m not sure where I’m gonna be tomorrow, much less next week, but we’re fully supportive of Kash’s nomination. I actually think he’s in a very good spot for his nomination,” Vance said. Vance, who was touring Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Fairview, North Carolina, alongside North Carolina Sens. Tom Tillis and Ted Budd and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said we “need a government who responds quickly to the needs of its citizens” and does a “better job when it comes to communications infrastructure.” Vance was critical of the Biden administration for bureaucratic slowness and said that he believes the government could be doing more to show the people of Western North Carolina that they care about them. Vance also punted on a question on who he would like to replace him as Senator from Ohio. “I want Tom Tillis to replace me, but unfortunately, he’s got a job here in the state of North Carolina, and will so long as the people of North Carolina are willing to have him serve again. We’re focused on the people here in western North Carolina, and that’s where we’re going to focus on the remainder of our short visit,” he said. He also was vague when asked about if he and Trump have spoken about what portfolio he would like to take on as vice president. “Look, I mean, we’re going to work on a lot as vice president. The President is going to work on a lot as president United States, we’re certainly focused today on the people of North Carolina, and I’m sure that you know, when I’m vice president, I’m going to be in a much better job to help people out here in western North Carolina. That’s what I care about,” Vance said. The White House sidestepped questions on the possibility of President Joe Biden to people who could be targeted in a Trump administration. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president, but what I can say is that the president is reviewing other pardons and commutations,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday, her first on-camera briefing since the president pardoned his son, Hunter Biden. Jean-Pierre later disputed the characterization that she wasn’t ruling out preemptive pardons, saying, “I’m not confirming anything. I’m just saying I’m not going to get – there’s a process.” Those comments come after CNN reported that senior Biden White House aides, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington, DC, are discussing potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for people who might be targeted for prosecution by President-elect Donald Trump after he retakes power, according to multiple sources. The move, which would cover people who haven’t ever been formally accused of any crimes, would be an extraordinary step and shows the grave concerns many Democrats have that Trump will prosecute a range of figures that he considers to be his enemies. On Friday, Jean-Pierre pointed to Biden’s previous actions on pardons and commutations, including those for marijuana possession convictions, nonviolent drug offenders who demonstrated commitment to rehabilitation, and military convictions for LGBTQ+ servicemembers, previewing “more to come” on that front, likely “around the holidays.” Pressed once more, Jean-Pierre indicated that Biden is “reviewing next steps.” Jean-Pierre also faced an onslaught of questions about – and her own credibility – after the White House insisted for months the president would not pardon Hunter Biden. Asked if Biden regretted misleading the public about the eventual pardon, the White House press secretary would not directly answer. Jean-Pierre was also asked if she owed an apology to the press and the American people, to which she strongly pushed back. “I know what I said,” she said. “I know what the president said. That is where we were at the time. That is where the president was at the time. I am his spokesperson. This weekend, he thought about it he wrestled with it. He wrestled with it and made this decision. That’s what I can tell the American people.” Vice President-elect JD Vance offered his full support for , telling reporters he has spoken to a number of senators, including Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, and that he believes Hegseth will get confirmed. “Pete Hegseth is going to get his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, not a sham hearing before the American media. We believe that Pete Hegseth is the right guy to lead the Department of Defense. That’s why President Trump nominated him. We’re not abandoning this nomination,” Vance said. “We’re not going to make it easy for people to allow the media to determine who our secretary of defense is. Donald J. Trump, who just won an election by a very significant margin, with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, that’s who determines who the Secretary of Defense is,” he added. Ernst signaled Thursday in an interview on Fox that she is not fully behind a Hegseth nomination. Earlier today, President-elect Donald Tump in a Truth Social post. “Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe. He was a great student - Princeton/Harvard educated - with a Military state of mind. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!” . While the president-elect had been supporting Hegseth behind the scenes, this is the first time in recent days he has publicly rallied around him. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez officially announced her bid to in a letter to colleagues. “I write to you today to seek your support to serve as Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability in the 119th Congress,” the lawmaker wrote in the letter. “In the 119th Congress, Oversight Committee Democrats will face an important task: we must balance our focus on the incoming president’s corrosive actions and corruption with a tangible fight to make life easier for America’s working class.” The New York Democrat will face Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia for the perch, which is an important role for Democrats as they look to counter Trump in his second term. Connolly is the only other candidate in the race so far, but many lawmakers have been waiting to see what Ocasio-Cortez does. The jockeying is part of broader Democratic efforts to shake up committee leadership and push for a new generation of leaders as the party grapples with how to counter President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress in the new year. Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York has decided not to continue his post as the top Democrat on House Judiciary Committee, paving the way for Raskin to take over, leaving the vacancy atop House Oversight. Back in the late 1880s, when unqualified political appointees were wasting taxpayer dollars, there was a move to professionalize government workers in a . The effort gained momentum after then-President James Garfield was by a disaffected former supporter with mental illness who was angry at not getting a job in Garfield’s administration. The political “spoils” system, which the bureaucracy replaced, was demonized for its cronyism, inefficiency and graft. Now, ironically, President-elect Donald Trump demonizes professional government workers as part of a “deep state,” and his incoming administration wants to uproot and replace them with political appointees more responsive to elected officials. History undoing itself. There’s a much more recent and applicable chapter that directly echoes Trump’s appointment of efficiency czars in Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who were on Capitol Hill Thursday to gain support for the nongovernmental advisory effort they’re spinning up and calling the , or DOGE. Three decades ago, the new president promising change was Democrat Bill Clinton. His charge to then-Vice President Al Gore was to streamline government through a National Performance Review, or NPR. Supporters referred to it in shorthand as “reinventing government,” or REGO. There are some major differences, but then, as now, the plan was to take a holistic look at government and recommend changes to improve how taxpayer dollars are spent, including by , and more. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan’s commission began its quest to get rid of hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. Much like DOGE, it had no authority to implement changes, only to advise. And after a couple of years of work, the Grace Commission’s 150-plus members persuaded Congress to enact exactly zero of its recommendations. — and the $2 trillion math problem looming for DOGE. Vice President Kamala Harris’ defunct presidential campaign had just $1.8 million in its account on November 25, according to with federal regulators, having virtually emptied its massive war chest of more than $1 billion. The final cash on hand total follows intense scrutiny of the Harris campaign’s management of resources in its losing effort. Her frenzied spending in the final weeks of the campaign and Democrats’ aggressive efforts to secure donations after the election and raised alarms that her campaign was grappling with unpaid bills. But after record-breaking fundraising, Harris’ operation appears set to close its books without debt, reporting $1.82 million in cash on hand. The new report, covering activity from October 17 through November 25, also showed the Harris campaign burning through money during the intense home stretch – spending more than $270 million during that period. For the entire campaign — including outgoing President Joe Biden’s time as the Democratic nominee — the campaign spent roughly $1.2 billion, according to the filing. It’s a gargantuan total, underscoring the soaring expense of modern campaigns, as well as the limits of financial firepower — Harris consistently outraised Trump — against unforgiving political headwinds. President-elect Donald Trump recently converted his presidential campaign committee into It reported more than $11 million in debts as of November 25, largely owed to an Iowa firm for “telemarketing & data management,” according to its filing. The committee still had nearly $9.9 million in available cash at the end of the reporting period. Sen. John Kennedy’s folksy patter can be funny, often offensive and occasionally contrived. But the Louisiana Republican on Thursday put his finger on one of President-elect Donald Trump’s greatest challenges. Kennedy was considering the task facing and in their project to cut the size of government and what many see as “waste” that pervades its spending. “My experience has been trying to convince people to cut it, it’s kind of like going to heaven. Everybody’s ready to go to heaven, but nobody’s willing to take the trip,” Kennedy told CNN’s Lauren Fox. While he was referring to the nascent Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a nebulous body Trump plans to set up to gut the Washington bureaucracy and regulations, Kennedy’s comment applies to a broader reality that will weigh on the president-elect when he takes office next year. Even the 47th president won’t be able to do everything on his own. Trump will be one of the most powerful presidents in modern history, with a monopoly on power in Congress and a sympathetic conservative Supreme Court majority. His dominance of the GOP and power to punish the few remaining party heretics who defy his will suggests he should be able to quickly push through his agenda. The president-elect — who leads Vice President Kamala Harris by — swept all seven swing states and became the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote while pushing many Democratic districts to the right. But lasting policy change cannot be affected without Congress, where the GOP will have an especially narrow margin the House. Kash Patel, President-Elect Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, has received an endorsement from the National Police Association. The law enforcement advocacy group announced its support Friday morning, writing in a post on X, “The National Police Association Endorses Kash Patel for FBI Director.” The post linked to a , which featured a formal statement of endorsement, emphasizing Patel’s qualifications and stating that he is aligned with law enforcement values. “The law enforcement community knows that effective leadership at the FBI is essential for building public trust and enhancing coordination across all levels of policing,” the association wrote. “Kash Patel’s proven record of leadership, expertise in counterterrorism and intelligence, and ability to navigate complex legal and operational challenges make him the ideal candidate to restore faith in the FBI’s mission and ensure it remains a steadfast ally to our nation’s police forces.” Patel is for the FBI post — and one whose value to the president-elect largely derives from their shared disdain for established power in Washington. Putting Patel in charge of the FBI would require forcing out the agency’s current director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017, before his 10-year term expires in three years. That anticipated move has prompted bipartisan criticism. Vice President-elect JD Vance shared his own message of support for secretary of defense pick Pete Hegseth, following President-elect Donald Trump’s message this morning. “Led by President Trump, we’re fighting for Pete Hegseth. And we’re doing so because Pete Hegseth wil fight for our troops. For too long, the Pentagon has been led by people who lose wars. Pete Hegseth is a man who fought in those wars. We’ve got his back,” . Hegseth held meetings on Capitol Hill this week as he seeks to shore up support with key senators who will vote on his confirmation. As some amid a series of allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct that have emerged since he was chosen for the role, Hegseth has denied the allegations and . South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, President-elect Donald Trump’s , is expected to meet with senators next week, according to a source familiar with the plans. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is among those expected to attend the meeting, which is scheduled for next Wednesday afternoon. Incoming first lady Melania Trump on Friday discussed transitioning back into the White House for the second time during her first sit-down interview since Election Day. “It’s incredible and we are very, very busy. … I’m establishing my transition team and also working on my office, putting my office together. And also, you know, organizing the residence and packing,” Trump said to “Fox & Friends.” Having already spent four years in the White House, Trump said she doesn’t feel it is necessary to make an earlier visit ahead of Inauguration Day. “Well, this time, it’s very different because we already know where we are going, and we have all of the plans from before, so we don’t need to go back in. My team is in contact with the White House, so that’s a plus, but we have all what we need. So, this is the second time, so it’s nothing new,” Trump said. CNN that she is unlikely to move to Washington full time in her second go-round as first lady, showing signs of her willingness to buck tradition as she returns to her high-profile but unelected role on the world stage. Asked about President-elect Donald Trump’s temperament during his transition for his second term compared to his 2016 victory, the incoming first lady reiterated that “it’s very different.” Following the two assassination attempts on her husband earlier this year, Trump said she hopes a second term brings unity when asked if she feels the rhetoric has toned down. “I hope it is. I hope the country will be united, and that’s what we all hope for, and you know, I’m always against violence. I think nothing is accomplished with the violence,” she said. If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: President-elect Donald Trump plans to boost the cryptocurrency industry while continuing a broad antitrust crackdown on Big Tech giants such as Amazon, Meta and Google. That combination would appear to reward Trump’s wealthiest and most influential donors in Silicon Valley, some of whom have specifically called for less regulation of crypto and weakening the power of large tech monopolies. In short, it’s the venture capitalist tech agenda. On Wednesday, Trump said he plans to nominate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gail Slater to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, two key appointments that will heavily influence his administration’s relationship with the tech sector. Atkins is a crypto advocate and a co-chairman of the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber, a major blockchain trade association. Slater, an economic adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance, served in the first Trump White House. Earlier in her career, Slater spent more than a decade working on antitrust investigations and technology policy as a staffer at the Federal Trade Commission. Trump’s choices here won’t get as much attention as some of his , but they could have a huge impact — not just on the price of bitcoin, on Wednesday in anticipation of a crypto-friendly administration, but also on the future of the digital economy writ large. President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for his embattled choice for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, in a . “Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe. He was a great student - Princeton/Harvard educated - with a Military state of mind. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!” Trump posted. While the president-elect had been supporting Hegseth behind the scenes, this is the first time in recent days he has publicly rallied around him. plowed at least $260 million into efforts to send Donald Trump back to the White House, new filings show — a massive infusion that makes him one of the largest single political underwriters of a presidential campaign and underscores the outsized influence of the world’s wealthiest person on this year’s election. Thursday’s filings with the Federal Election Commission show that the Tesla and SpaceX executive gave a total of $238 million to a super PAC that he founded this year, America PAC, which worked to turn out voters on Trump’s behalf in key states. But he also was the financial backer of other groups that cropped up in the final days of the election to support Trump, including one that spent millions on advertising to defend his record on abortion. It had sought to link Trump’s views on abortion to those of late Supreme Court Justice and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Musk, through a trust that bears his name, donated $20.5 million to the group, named RBG PAC, on October 24, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. He was the sole donor to the group, which was formed in mid-October. The donation’s timing meant that Musk’s involvement was not disclosed until Thursday’s post-election filings with the federal regulators. According to the new filings, Musk also donated $3 million to the MAHA Alliance, a super PAC that to back Trump in the closing stretch of the campaign. Kennedy himself had ended his independent campaign over the summer and endorsed Trump. Pete Hegseth’s name has been submitted to the FBI for a background check, his attorney told CNN Thursday night, as some lawmakers call for more vetting of President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the Pentagon. “He received the forms yesterday from the FBI, and we’re working on them right now,” attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source,” when asked whether Trump has submitted his name to the FBI. Hegseth, a military veteran and former television anchor tapped to serve as defense secretary, concluded his first week of meetings on Capitol Hill earlier Thursday as he seeks to shore up support with key senators who will vote on his confirmation. As some amid a series of allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct that have emerged since he was chosen for the role, Hegseth has denied the allegations and . The president-elect’s transition team paved the way for it to seek the background checks, announcing that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Justice Department. “I am expecting that the background check is going to take a lot of the false stories that have been circulated in the media and it’s going to put them completely to bed,” Parlatore said. Hegseth faces a tough confirmation process as allegations continue to mount related to his workplace behavior and treatment of women, including a surfaced sexual assault allegation from 2017, which Hegseth has denied. , the military veteran and television anchor tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to run the Pentagon, has concluded a first week of meetings on Capitol Hill with “no noes on the board,” according to a senior transition official. Hegseth’s selection has been clouded by allegations of excessive drinking, mistreatment of women and embezzlement of money — resulting in conversations with lawmakers that focused more on his character than his plans for the sprawling Defense Department. While Hegseth’s team acknowledges there are senators who have not yet committed to a “yes,” his advisers also appear more optimistic than earlier this week when Trump sources suggested the . Hegseth is expected to face another round of grilling next week, when he plans to meet with Sens. Josh Hawley, Susan Collins and others. He will be joined by another crop of Trump picks: Kristi Noem, the choice for Department of Homeland Security; Linda McMahon, the choice for the Department of Education; Howard Lutnick, whom Trump wants to oversee the Commerce department; and others chosen to run agencies who have not grabbed the same headlines. , Trump’s controversial pick to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation — which has an independent director whose term is not finished — will also meet with lawmakers. Tulsi Gabbard, tapped to be Trump’s director of national intelligence, is also finalizing plans for a potential visit to the Hill as well. Senior Biden White House aides, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington, DC, are discussing potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for people who might be targeted for prosecution by President-elect Donald Trump after he retakes power, multiple sources told CNN. Reports of these conversations have captured the attention of Trump’s legal advisers, who, according to a source familiar with their strategy, believe President Joe Biden would be setting a new precedent in terms of the scope of pardons that they could take advantage of, down the line, to help their own allies. Biden’s senior aides inside the White House have been deliberating for weeks about the possibility of issuing preemptive pardons, according to the sources familiar with the discussions. The move, which would cover people who haven’t ever been formally accused of any crimes, would be an extraordinary step and shows the grave concerns many Democrats have that Trump will prosecute a range of figures that he considers to be his enemies.

The historic decision means a second-round runoff that was scheduled for Sunday, when Georgescu would have gone head to head with his centrist rival Elena Lasconi, will no longer take place. In a press release, the court said the annulment was based on Article 146(f) of the Constitution, emphasizing the need to ensure the correctness and legality of the electoral process. The court’s decision, announced Friday, is final and binding. It requires the Romanian government to restart the electoral calendar. Friday’s decision caps off a troubled election cycle in the country, with the same court last week ordering a recount of the first-round votes. It also comes just days after the vote was hit with fears over foreign interference, after declassified documents from Romania’s top security council revealed evidence of “aggressive hybrid Russian attacks.” They also showed how Georgescu was boosted by potential interference on TikTok – the social media platform on which he largely ran his campaign – through algorithms, coordinated accounts and paid promotion, Reuters reported. One of the declassified documents, from the Romanian intelligence agency, detailed more than 85,000 attempted cyber-attacks on election websites and IT systems, and concluded that “the attacker has considerable resources specific to an attacking state,” Reuters reported. These findings prompted the US State Department to express concern on Wednesday and warn that a shift away from the West “would have serious negative impacts on U.S. security cooperation with Romania.” In a later statement Friday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: “The United States reaffirms our confidence in Romania’s democratic institutions and processes, including investigations into foreign malign influence.” Georgescu, 62, started his campaign with single-digit support but enjoyed a shock rise to prominence, narrowly emerging as leader in the election’s first round with 22.9% of the vote to Lasconi’s 19.2%. While he has not described himself as specifically pro-Russian, Georgescu had previously labeled Ukraine an “invented state” and declared he wants a strategy of “peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.” A Romanian official on Wednesday described Georgescu’s success in the first round as shocking. They told CNN that his victory would be “an extraordinary triumph for… (Russian President Vladimir) Putin” and “would cancel the whole progress that Romania has made in the past 35 years.” Georgescu centered his campaign on tackling the country’s cost-of-living crisis, and vowed to end Romania’s support for Ukraine. Romania shares a 400-mile border with its northern neighbor and under its previous presidency helped export millions of tons of grain out of the war-stricken country. Meanwhile, the center-right Lasconi, of the Save Romania Union (USR) party, ran a campaign pledging to keep Romania on its pro-Western course. The court’s decision to cancel the election came the day after a large protest in the Romanian capital Bucharest, when hundreds turned out to rally in favor of Lasconi and against the far right. A small group of counter-protesters also rallied in support of Georgescu on Thursday night. Protesters held banners reading “Romania, a landmark in the EU and NATO” and “No fascism.” “I’m here today to protest against this fascist movement that is coming here, to Romania, against this leader that they have, Calin Georgescu, who appeared out of nowhere, clearly sponsored by Putin and by Moscow and we’re fighting against all the things that went wrong during this campaign,” one demonstrator called Mihai told Reuters. Another protester, a student named Daniel, pointed to “a lot of fraud, suspected fraud at the voting stations” in the first-round vote. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Health insurer Medica temporarily closed its Minnetonka, Minnesota, headquarters as a safety precaution, a spokesperson told CNN. “We closed the HQ out of an abundance of caution following the shooting” of Thompson, the spokesperson said in an email. CVS and other health care companies have removed photographs of CEOs and other executive leaders from their websites after Thompson’s killing early Wednesday morning outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan. It’s common for top executives of major corporations to have personal security provided by their companies. But companies in a wide range of industries are racing to enhance security measures for executives in the wake of the killing. “The reach-out from companies in the last two days has been very urgent,” Glen Kucera, the head of Allied Universal’s enhanced protection services unit, told CNN. “It’s been eye-opening to a lot of companies in how they go about protecting their executives.” A manhunt is underway for the shooter. The words were found on a live round and shell casing, according to law enforcement sources. The killing has unleashed from social media users over denials of their medical claims. Kucera said companies have taken a variety of measures since the killing. Some are asking for armed security personnel for executives as they travel and commute to work from their homes. Other companies are stepping up their monitoring of threats on social media platforms. Some of these measures are short-term, but Kucera expects a permanent impact from the killing. Investors and companies’ boards of directors will demand more periodic risk assessments for high-risk executives, he said. Dozens of companies have expanded armed security protection for C-suite executives, including permanent security presences, in response to the killing, said Dale Buckner, the CEO of Global Guardian, which provides executive protection for a wide range of industries. Buckner said that in the first several hours following the shooting, 47 companies contacted Global Guardian requesting additional executive security. “This is a bellwether moment and a shift,” he said. Buckner said that executives often travel with armed security protection when they go overseas, but such security details have been growing in the United States in recent years. Around-the-clock armed security personnel at executives’ homes has also been increasing. After the attack, UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare, laid out security plans for employees. “We’re ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of our employees,” said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, in an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by CNN. The health insurance company is fully cooperating with law enforcement as the search for the shooter continues, the email said. “Several support mechanisms” are being put in place for employees, Witty said. “We have increased security at our campuses in Minnesota, in addition to sites in Washington, DC, and New York City areas.” That includes temporarily barring visitors from entering administrative campuses, he added. As an added precaution, some health insurance companies have made their executive staff less visible on their sites. Like UnitedHealthcare, which removed its executive page, Elevance Health, the parent company of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and affiliated plans, removed a page listing senior leadership on Friday. That’s according to nonprofit internet archive Wayback Machine, which documents when web URLs are removed or instructed to redirect users to a different page. Elevance Health did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment. CVS, which owns Aetna, told CNN it removed photos of executives after the UnitedHealth CEO’s killing, but it left many of their bios up. CVS declined to comment further. Centete opted for the same move, though it’s not clear when it decided to remove photos of executives between Friday and two months ago, when photos of executives were last documented as being on the page, according to Wayback Machine records. The company didn’t respond to CNN’s request for a comment. Still, even as health insurance companies removed information about executives from their sites, many executives kept their names, titles and photos up on other sites like LinkedIn as well as in press releases. In many cases, it will likely be impossible for these figures to entirely remove their digital footprint and association with their employers, given that many have had numerous public speaking engagements as well as television interviews posted online.

The answer is Nepal. But beyond the simple fact of its uncommon shape, Nepal’s flag is a bit of a mystery. Depending who you ask, the flag represents the movement of the heavens, modern nation-building, Buddhist and Hindu legacy, Asian pride, political maneuvering or some combination of all of them. The flag is easily spotted among its peers: it is comprised of two crimson-colored rightward-pointing isosceles triangles, decorated with a navy blue border and two white shapes that represent the sun (on the lower half) and the moon (on the upper one). “That particular shape, the single pennon and double pennon, is not unique to Nepal. It has a long and deep history in South Asia and in the Indian subcontinent,” explains Sanjog Rupakheti, a professor of history at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts and a Nepal native. “We were taught in school growing up that the sun and moon … represent the eternity of the nation, triangles supposedly representing the (Himalayan) mountains that Nepal is known for. As a historian, I think a better and a more persuasive interpretation would be to see these symbols as representing these mythical, ancient, illustrious dynasties that many ruling elites in the region often styled their genealogy after.” Some people believe that the red color represents Nepal’s national flower, the rhododendron, while others say it’s meant to symbolize war and bravery. Rupakheti is quick to point out that even Nepali history scholars aren’t completely sure about the full backstory of the national flag. One of the earliest depictions of the flag comes from sketches by Henry Ambrose Oldfield, a British doctor and artist who lived in Nepal in the mid-1800s. English journalist and travel writer Perceval Landon also talked about a double pennon flag in his book “Nepal,” which was published in 1928. Although Landon’s picture of the flag was in black and white, he includes a footnote clarifying the flag’s border was green, not blue. Previous versions of the flag, including the ones drawn by Landon, depict the sun and moon with human faces. Before the establishment of democracy in Nepal – originally in 1990, then again in 2008 – it was forbidden for most regular Nepalis to display flags at their homes. “National flags could only be unfurled and could only be displayed at government premises,” explains Rupakheti. “There were definitely very strict guidelines, not just on the shape and size, but also when, how, and who could display a flag. But that gradually began to change with the opening up of the democratic experiment. And now it’s everywhere.” Nepal’s flag is a popular one among flag obsessives, who refer to themselves as vexillologists. Ted Kaye, secretary of the North American Vexillogical Association (NAVA), says that the flag’s history and shape make it a common conversation topic. “Maps and flags have an interesting cultural and geographical overlay,” says Kaye. “The rest of Asia has given in to the colonial view that a flag should be a rectangle, but Nepal is this holdout that connects to the history flags of Asia.” Trivia junkies may be drawn to Nepal’s flag for its non-quadrilateral shape. But the flag is also studied by mathematicians. “It’s the nerdiest mathematical flag that is out there,” Kaye adds. In 1962, King Mahendra asked a mathematician to develop precise specifications for the size and shape of the Nepali flag that would be used to standardize the flag. Those specifications are . Among the rules: the sun must have 12 rays, both the sun and moon must be white, and the border color is specified as “deep blue.” As for the rest, it’s probably better to have advanced knowledge of geometry to make sure you’re doing it right. Nepal’s unusual flag shape has also become a challenge for international events. At the Olympics, there is a rule that , which can result in some of them looking oddly stretched out. Though some previous Olympics organizers have attempted to standardize the Nepali flag by sticking it on a white rectangular background, the IOC ruled that Nepal’s flag can remain as is. Nepal is, once again, a proud exception to the rule. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

A US appeals court on Friday that requires TikTok to be sold off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a ban, dealing a major blow to the social media platform that’s used by more than 170 million Americans. Under the law, app stores could face major fines if they continue to host TikTok following the deadline, if it’s not sold. For users who already have the app downloaded, that likely means they could continue to use it for a while but would not be able to receive updates, which would eventually make it buggy and potentially useless. While the ruling increases the likelihood that TikTok will be banned, it’s not a done deal just yet. TikTok indicated that it plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement Friday. However, the company suggested it has not budged on its earlier stance that it would not separate from ByteDance. Hughes said: “The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.” Beyond a successful appeal, there are a few other ways a TikTok ban could be delayed or avoided, including potential support from President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office. President Joe Biden could also technically grant a one-time, 90-day extension of the deadline, although he has not indicated that he will do so. When it appeals the ruling, TikTok could also ask for a stay — essentially, a pause — of the law while the Supreme Court reviews the case, which could mean TikTok avoids the January ban deadline, at least temporarily. Stay or not, there’s reason to believe the Supreme Court will move quickly to render a decision on the case. Both TikTok and the US government had previously asked the US appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the ban deadline. “The Supreme Court could set a schedule for briefing and set an oral argument in the first week of January,” Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN. However, Schiller said TikTok is still likely to face an uphill battle in the Supreme Court. “Given the composure of the Supreme Court being largely conservative, and largely ideologically in favor of a limited federal government, even with that background … I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” and therefore rule in favor of upholding the law, Schiller said. The Supreme Court could also decide not to review the case, in which case TikTok may be out of luck, according to Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School. “I am skeptical that the Supreme Court will take this case,” said Hans, who had signed on to an amicus brief supporting TikTok in the case. “They were pretty careful to write the opinion in a way that makes it less likely the Supreme Court would grant a review, and I think part of that has to do with the national security implications here… the court was really willing to take those claims seriously.” Trump could also represent a lifeline for TikTok’s US presence. Although it was Trump who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States during his previous term, he has more recently suggested that he to ban the app. Trump said in June — in a posted to the platform itself — that he would “never ban TikTok.” However, it’s not clear whether Trump will be able to , given the ban is set to go into effect one day before his inauguration. Trump could ask Congress to repeal the law, although experts say that effort would probably fail. From there, he likely has two options: He could direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or he could announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein last month. The first approach would involve signaling to TikTok’s tech partners like Apple — which stand to face fines under the law if it continued to host TikTok on its app store after the deadline — that they “should feel free to continue business with TikTok,” Rozenshtein said. “But again, if you’re the general counsel of Apple, does that really give you a lot of confidence? You’re still violating the law. Trump is very mercurial.” The second option would rely on a portion of the law that gives the president some authority to determine if a “qualified divestiture” of TikTok has taken place. In theory, Trump could declare that it has, whether or not that’s true, and then would have to hope it doesn’t get challenged in court. That approach could be more successful, given that “it’s not clear who could sue to enforce the law,” Rozenstein said. Friday’s ruling renewed jitters over a potential ban among who go to the platform to find connection, get entertained, seek information and earn a living. Some TikTok users had previously urged their representatives to vote “no” on the law. Others said that transitioning a large audience from TikTok to another platform is tricky, because each site has its own unique algorithm and monetization scheme. “TikTok is a huge part of my income and my livelihood, so I don’t want to see it falter,” lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk told CNN Friday. “However, there has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical. All we can do is cross our fingers for now that it doesn’t get banned.” “I still have my hopes that TikTok will not get banned in the United States but, currently, it doesn’t look good,” another user said in a posted to the platform Friday. However, not every TikTok user is so concerned. “I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and creator who uses TikTok, told CNN. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It’s going to be a great future for sure,” Gout said, per . “I didn’t expect it to be that fast, but I guess I ran Australia’s fastest ever time in the 200. I have been chasing that record but I didn’t think it would come this year. I thought maybe next year or the year after that.” Gout broke onto the scene in 2022 when he as a 14-year-old. The last two years have seen the Australian, who turns 17 in late December, draw comparisons to sprinting great Usain Bolt. He garnered even further attention in August when he clocked in at at the 2024 World Athletics U20 Championships – 0.01 seconds faster than a 15-year-old Bolt managed in 2002, the record at the time. “My video went viral right before World Juniors and that already created pressure. But you know what they say, pressure makes diamonds and I guess I’m better than a diamond right now,” Gout added. “We just take little steps; beat my PB by 0.01 and 0.02. Chasing that big sub-20, it will be great for sure but I’m not expecting too much. “Right now, I can’t really process it. I guess tonight when I go to bed and think about it, it will be pretty crazy for sure. I have always done what I said I will do. If I said something, it’s on my mind and I am pursuing it until I do it.” Norman’s 20.06s earned him a surprise silver medal in the 200m final at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, but the race is more famous for what happened afterwards. Black American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos won gold and bronze, respectively, and each raised one fist on the podium in the now iconic Black Power salute, a protest aimed at highlighting the segregation and racism burning back in their homeland. In solidarity, Norman wore a badge on his left breast that read: “Olympic Project for Human Rights,” an organization set up a year previously that opposed to racism in sport. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Rebel factions representing the Druze sect in Daraa’s neighboring city of as-Suwayda also launched an offensive against Syrian regime forces there. Syria’s army said it is “redeploying” outside of the two southern cities after “terrorists” attacked military checkpoints. “Our forces operating in Daraa and as-Suwayda implemented a redeployment, repositioning and established a strong and cohesive defensive and security cordon in that direction,” the regime’s military said in a statement. The rebels are battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces from two directions; the north and the south, in an attempt to close in on Damascus. Daraa is where the Syrian uprising started in 2011. The southern factions are different from factions in the north led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who have already taken two major cities during their offensive that started over a week ago. Still, those groups aim for the same goal, which is toppling Assad. “Our forces have taken full control of the entire city of Daraa and have started combing through its neighborhoods and securing its institutions and government offices,” local rebel fighters known as the Southern Operations Room said in a statement late Friday. A video, geolocated by CNN, shows rebels outside the Daraa administrative building. The offensives have reawakened a civil war that had been largely dormant for years. The conflict began in 2011, after Assad moved to stamp out peaceful pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. The fighting swelled as other regional actors and world powers – from Saudi Arabia and the United States to Iran and Russia – piled in, escalating the civil war into what some observers described as a “proxy war.” More than 300,000 civilians have been killed in more than a decade of war, according to the United Nations, with millions more displaced across the region. On Friday, rebels in southern Syria also took control of a Syria-Jordan border crossing, after launching a fresh assault. The Nassib border crossing marks the southernmost point of the major M5 highway, which runs the length of the country from the northern city of Aleppo and through the capital. In a video geolocated by CNN, armed fighters were seen marching down a road by the Nassib border crossing, after wrestling it from government control. The rebels in the north, after capturing Aleppo a week ago, have pushed south along the highway and on Thursday took the city of Hama. They have now set their sights on Homs. And as anti-regime offensives gather pace both to the north and south of the capital Damascus, Kurdish-led fighters say they have moved into eastern parts of Syria. Kurdish forces occupy the northeast of the country, having achieved hard-won autonomy during a decade of civil war. They fear that autonomy could now be under threat from the Syrian opposition insurgents. Although the stated target of the rebel offensive is the Assad regime, Kurdish fighters have said they fear the violence could spill over into their territory. Hundreds of people appear to have fled the central city of Homs overnight into Friday. Videos showed hundreds of vehicles lining the highway out of Homs, as the city braces for violence. After capturing to the north on Thursday, the rebels set their sights on the crossroads city of Homs which, if captured, would split the territory under the control of the regime in two. “From here we direct the last call to the regime forces, this is your chance to defect,” said the Military Operations Media of the armed opposition groups led by HTS, in a statement. Late on Friday, the rebels claimed to have seized the last village on the outskirts of Homs city, saying they are at the city walls. The goal of Syria’s rebel coalition, which has wrested two major cities from government control in just over a week, is ultimately to overthrow the decades-old Assad regime, the militant leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, told CNN in an on Thursday. “When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,” said Jolani. Homs has a sizeable population of Alawites, co-religionists of Assad, many of whom fear retribution from rebels who accuse Alawites of dominating the country and supporting Assad’s quashing of the rebellion. After bursting out of their pocket of territory in the northwest region of Idlib, the rebels captured Aleppo within three days and Hama within eight, meeting minimal resistance from regime forces which were caught flat-footed by the lightning offensive. It is not clear whether regime forces will be able to defend the city of Homs, about an hour’s drive south of Hama. CNN was unable to reach multiple contacts in Homs on Friday, amid reports of an internet blackout as the rebels approached the city. The rebels’ progress has been met with celebration from many residents of the newly captured cities who had lived under regime rule for years. Videos geolocated by CNN showed rebel fighters cheering – almost in disbelief at their progress – as they entered Hama. “Guys, my country is being liberated. I swear to God, we are inside Hama city, we are inside Aleppo city,” a fighter cheered as he filmed himself by Alaarbaen Roundabout in Hama. The rebels led by HTS said they freed hundreds of those “wrongfully detained” from Hama’s central prison. The city was the site of one of Syria’s largest massacres in 1982, when President Hafez al-Assad – the current ruler’s father – ordered his military to quash a revolt. In the interview with CNN, Jolani said HTS aimed to create a government based on institutions and a “council chosen by the people.” Although the prospect of the rapid collapse of the Assad regime was scarcely conceivable just over a week ago, Jolani said: “The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it… the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: this regime is dead.” The foreign ministers of Iran, Iraq and Syria met in Baghdad Friday and said in a joint statement that the advance of opposition forces in Syria poses “a serious danger to the three countries, threatens the security of their peoples and the region as a whole.” The three countries described the Syrian armed opposition forces as “terrorists,” stressing that there was “a need for collective action to confront it.” Then officials from Russia, Iran and Turkey met in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday to discuss the escalation in Syria. Israel has instructed its forces “to maintain a high level of preparedness and to continuously monitor the developments,” in Syria as rebels advance, the country’s defense ministry said in a statement Friday. The Israeli military “is prepared for any scenario and is determined to protect the citizens of Israel and protect Israel’s security interests at all times,” the statement said. The US on Friday urged its citizens to depart Syria “now while commercial options remain available in Damascus.” “U.S. citizens who choose not to depart Syria or are unable to depart should prepare contingency plans for emergency situations and be prepared to shelter in place for extended periods. The Aleppo International Airport is closed,” the State Department said in a statement, citing the “volatile and unpredictable” security situation. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

But the man who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO outside a busy hotel keeps evading capture. Now, authorities say he might have – meaning the elusive gunman could be anywhere. It could take weeks to find and scrub through a massive array of video footage from all the places where the gunman may have traveled. Police believe the suspect arrived in New York City 10 days before the killing – on November 24, a law enforcement official told CNN. Throughout his stay, the suspect appeared on camera numerous times – but always kept his hood over his head and wore a mask in public places. “He knows he’s on camera – it’s New York,” said John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. Police are searching for and scouring countless hours of video footage in hopes of finding more clues, such as whether the suspect met with anyone while in the city. “It will take them weeks. … They will build out every step of his trip that’s on video,” Miller said. “They will create a movie of his every move.” While the gunman meticulously planned many parts of his crime and getaway, he might be surprised by “how far the NYPD is going to go in collecting video,” said former NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey. “And they’re not just going to take it from the crime scene to his escape route,” Corey said. “They’re actually going to rewind now, and they’re going to try to account for all 10 days that he spent in New York City. And I don’t think that he anticipates that.” Minutes after Thompson was gunned down Wednesday, surveillance video captured the suspect riding an electric bike into colossal Central Park at 6:48 a.m. Spanning , Central Park is larger than the . “It’s a big park, and it’s complicated terrain,” Miller said. The suspect apparently left the park within minutes. After reviewing security footage, police believe he may have left the park through the West 77th Street exit – but without the “ ” seen on the suspect during the shooting. At 7 a.m., a man resembling the suspect was spotted , private surveillance footage shows. Law enforcement told CNN they have reviewed the video and believe it likely shows the gunman. Some have portrayed the killer as a man enacting vigilante justice against a health care system , which could hinder some people’s motivation to report possible sightings of him. The evidence suggests the gunman viewed himself as a “Batman-type figure that was seeking justice on behalf of people that he thinks he’s representing,” said Bryanna Fox, a professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. The words “delay” and “depose” were written on a live round and a shell casing linked to the shooter, law enforcement sources told CNN. Police are investigating whether those words suggest a motive. The words are similar to a popular phrase about the insurance industry: “ .” Tens of thousands of social media users mocked the death of the health insurance CEO and showed little sympathy after the killing. A post by UnitedHealthcare’s parent company received more than 82,000 reactions as of Friday; 76,000 of them were laughing emojis. An image of the suspect with his mask down – captured during a with a hostel employee – is the best photo yet to help identify the suspect, authorities said. But contrary to popular belief, facial recognition software doesn’t always link a suspect’s face and identity, said Donnie Scott, CEO of IDEMIA Group, which specializes in facial recognition technology. “Most Americans may believe that law enforcement has images on everybody in the United States. That’s very much not true,” he said. “If he happens to not be a resident of New York who happens to not have been arrested before, odds are he’s not going to be in their criminal database or their mugshot repository,” Scott said. “So what’s likely happening across all law enforcement is they’re looking for this image in their local systems to see if this perpetrator exists in their galleries.” Some believe police can just cross-check a suspect’s face with driver’s license photos from the Department of Motor Vehicles. But the reality is not that simple. “It’s a legal permissioning process. The state of New York does not have access to the DMV database for law enforcement purposes by statute,” Scott said. “It requires cooperation and information sharing and a reason and willingness by the respective agencies to be allowed to share that by law.” Facial recognition technology should not be used alone to identify a suspect, Scott said. “Our job is really to make law enforcement’s job easier. If you think about the real basis and use of facial recognition technologies, it’s to sift through the millions and millions of images to get it down to a small, small subset that the expert can use to make the identification,” he said. “Face is not a fingerprint. It’s not DNA. It’s not used for (an) affirmative match. It’s used to get to a small enough number where that expert can say, ‘Yes, I believe we have an investigative lead here. What other evidence may we have that can match this person to the crime?’” Police are investigating a the suspect ran through. But extracting data from a phone can be extremely difficult, depending on the model of the phone and the operating system. “This is something that law enforcement at every level has been struggling with for the last 10 years … and that’s because of the ubiquity of end-to-end encryption and these incredibly secure kind of locking programs that we have on most phones,” said former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. During his time in the FBI, he recalled, “When we would take in an iPhone on a significant case, whether or not we could get into it had to do not only with the model of phone that it was, but also the specific iOS version that it was running.” For example, “you might be able to get into an iPhone 7 running iOS whatever, but you couldn’t get into one if it was running a different iOS,” McCabe said. “It’s a very complex matrix of hardware and software, and that’s kind of what determines whether or not law enforcement has the capability to get past that locking mechanism.” Even if authorities can “open up the phone,” he said, the technical challenges might not be over. “Once you get into the phone, then you’re dealing with the problem of encrypted content,” McCabe said. “Some users are not as disciplined, and they keep things like text messages and those sort of records on their phones, so you can read it off the device. But others are better at having messages expire and automatically deleted.” Detectives have recovered possible DNA evidence from the abandoned cell phone they believe the suspect may have sipped from. The potential DNA evidence was turned over to a lab for testing, a senior law enforcement official told Miller. But the presence of DNA data might not be enough to identify the suspect. If the suspect committed a crime previously and had his DNA entered into a law enforcement database, it may be easier to identify him. But if the suspect had a previously clean record, identifying him through DNA becomes harder. “If they’re able to pull DNA … but there’s no match to those DNA (samples), it’s going to be very difficult,” said Callahan Walsh, co-host of “America’s Most Wanted.” There’s a chance the suspect could be isolated using , if one of his relatives entered their DNA data into a public database. “They can bring in familial DNA, but that takes a little bit longer to process,” Walsh said. “There also has to be a match in a database somewhere from one of his family members.” Even though the suspect , the NYPD will keep searching for clues, said. “We are right now processing a tremendous amount of evidence in this case,” Tisch said Friday. “We already have lots of forensic evidence, fingerprints, DNA evidence,” plus a “massive camera canvass” of the suspected shooter’s movements through the city, she said. But despite the plethora of evidence, finding the suspect is an arduous task, McCabe said. “It’s far more complicated than it seems from the outside.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

While the incoming Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill have big ideas about how to spend their political capital, they will be limited by slim majorities in the House and Senate. For a better idea of what to expect, I talked to CNN congressional correspondent , who spends most of her time living and breathing in the rarified air of the Capitol building and the subterranean tunnels where representatives and senators walk or ride special trains back and forth from their offices. Our conversation, edited for style and length, is below: The most likely scenario right now is that they come up with a short-term patch, which , that would fund the government into probably early spring. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, has made clear his preference would be March. So that would give them an opportunity to punt, basically. It also gives Johnson an opportunity to get through his speaker race without having to pass what is known as the omnibus, or end-of-year, multi-bill extravaganza that we’ve seen in years past at the holidays. That’s something that’s really revolting to his right flank. Kicking this can into March and then dealing with it then probably is beneficial for Johnson. I would note that sticking a funding fight smack dab in the middle of the first 100 days (of Donald Trump’s presidency) would be complicated. It could make it hard to get the legislation that they want to focus on through. It just is another thing to check off the list, in addition to . These things can change and turn on a dime, but Johnson’s obviously got Trump’s backing. The two of them are very close, and , because he knows it can be so pivotal when you’re dealing with the kind of narrow majority that Johnson has. It’s not just that Trump’s helpful to preserving his speakership. Trump is helpful to getting people on board to any piece of the agenda that they want to move forward. If you think about down the road when they do tax reform, and you have just a handful of votes to lose, you’ve got to convince people who aren’t used to saying yes to say yes. My sense is if they can kick the can down the road on the spending bill, Johnson has a much easier time than we saw have two years ago with getting the speakership. We saw a really big indicator of how aware Republicans are of that reality earlier this week, when you had (incoming Senate Majority Leader) John Thune making clear to Republican senators that the most likely scenario is that they punt tax reform to later in the year, and they do a smaller piece of legislation that deals with defense, energy and immigration in the first 100 days. To me, and I think to Republican senators who I’ve spoken to, that signaled that they know they need some practice making sure they can move through this complicated budget process known as reconciliation. They need to make sure they can do it before they try to do it on tax, because tax is just a beast. They did it in 2017. They’ve obviously shown they can pass tax reform, but it is not easy to do, and there’s going to be a lot of disagreements between Senate Republicans and House Republicans. You’re dealing with a very narrow majority in the House and you’re dealing with a not-so-big majority in the Senate. When I saw that announcement from Thune, that he had told Republicans in their conference meeting that they were starting with another package, instead of tax reform, that was my indication that they are very aware of how slim the margins are. If they stick with the current order that they’re talking about – which is by the way, not a sure thing – but let’s say that they try to tackle immigration first, the budget process in the Senate that allows you to pass a bill with 51 votes, known as reconciliation, has a lot of limited parameters around what you can actually do. So Republicans can’t do wide, sweeping immigration policy changes through that first bill. But what they could do is invest a lot of money in border security. They could basically plus up how much they’re spending on those priorities, and they could move some money around. That could still be really significant for the Trump administration, because Trump talked about the border so much and because Republicans campaigned on that issue. I could very well see that being a major signature piece of legislation for Trump that would fit with his brand. On the other hand, you have a series of , and I do think Republicans are cognizant of that and don’t want a situation where Americans blame them for taxes going up or businesses blame them for taxes going up. So I think it’s possible that they could do both, but I do think that if immigration comes first, that’s probably the more likely victory. I don’t think Republicans are counting on Democrats for their tax bill. Even if there are provisions that Democrats might agree with, it’s going to be a big lift for them to get any Democratic votes, which is why they’re going to do this through reconciliation. Republican lawmakers are entertaining some of the ideas that Trump suggested on the campaign trail. There’s a reality, though, which is that some of those ideas cost a lot of money. Not taxing Social Security benefits – that costs a lot of money. And these things are going to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and Republicans are going to have to publicly defend why they’re adding to the deficit at a time when they’re saying the . There are Republicans in both the House and the Senate, on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, who have been working for a year now trying to brainstorm ideas of what they might want to include in another tax bill. And part of that has been getting a sense of how much some of these provisions cost. It’s really sort of a game of trying to match what you want to do with how much you want to spend. And that’s the really complicated part of this process. It’s going to have to be bipartisan in both the House and the Senate. And the reason is you cannot pass spending bills through reconciliation, which means you need 60 votes in the Senate. So my guess is, if you get Democrats in the Senate, you’re going to lose Republicans in the House and need Democrats in the House. So I think that that’s a trend that we’re just going to see continue. It’s hard to predict the dynamics that could cause a shutdown. For example, if we’re talking about March, which is potentially when we would have the next spending deadline, do you really want to have a shutdown in your first 100 days? I think that that’s the kind of political calculation you have to make, and so it’s hard to know, right? I would be very surprised if Republicans want to go down that road in Trump’s first 100 days. Does that dynamic change in September? Does that dynamic change at another point? It’s possible. It also is possible that Democrats dig in a little more, because they know that it would be cataclysmic to have a shutdown in Republicans’ first 100 days of trying to legislate. A couple of ways. Democrats are still going to be needed to do the basic functions of governing. When we are talking about the debt ceiling, when we’re talking about spending, it’s more likely than not that you are going to see Democrats helping. Because more likely than not, you’re going to see the middle – more swing-district Democrats, swing-district Republicans – working together to pass those bills. The other place that you’re going to see Democrats a lot is in these . They may not be using the same sort of hard-charging tactics we saw in the first Trump administration, when they would deny Republicans quorums for votes in committee or those kinds of things, but what we will see is they’re going to ask hard questions and make made-for-TV moments. The sense I’ve gotten, and I’ve reported on this pretty extensively, is that Democrats are really trying to figure out what happened in November, and they are being cautious about when they decide to dig in against Trump and when maybe that wouldn’t be beneficial. As Democrats have said to me, if you say everything’s a five-alarm fire, then nothing’s a five-alarm fire, right? They’re going to be cautious about where they pick their moments. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

An enduring mystique surrounds the Voyager 1 and 2 probes. Launched two weeks apart in 1977, the twin probes changed the way we see our solar system, sending back stunningly detailed views of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus. More than 47 years later, both spacecraft are still exploring the uncharted territory of interstellar space. And it’s not just their longevity that captivates. Voyager 1, at 15.5 billion miles away (24.9 billion kilometers), is the farthest human-made object from Earth. It’s astonishing to think that something crafted by teams of people on our planet is so far away, carrying a in case extraterrestrial intelligence crosses its path. But the Voyager team has become increasingly creative to keep both probes flying, and soon, the challenges may be too great to overcome. Voyager 1 is back online and operating normally after a weekslong communication blackout prevented engineers from receiving its science data. The issue resulted from the spacecraft’s dwindling power supply, which Voyager’s mission team has tried to protect by turning off nonessential systems. Of the 10 science instruments Voyager 1 started its journey with, four are currently gathering data on its cosmic environment, and each year, the . “But these probes have lasted so much longer than anyone anticipated they would, and it’s amazing that we’re squeezing every last bit of power (and science!) out of them,” said Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Scientists were puzzled in 1987 when a group of orcas began sporting salmon “hats” and swam around for weeks with the dead fish draped over their heads off the northwestern coast of North America. Now, a male orca has been photographed in Washington’s Puget Sound . But is this the return of an ’80s marine trend? Not so fast, scientists say. Meanwhile, new video and images revealed how an orca pod devised a successful, clever strategy for . Wolves are well-known predators, but they may play another surprising role: pollinators. Biologist Claudio Sillero first noticed endangered Ethiopian wolves exhibiting the unusual behavior in the late 1980s. He watched as the wolves deliberately licked the flowers of a red hot poker plant, which grows in the highlands. “I wasn’t quite expecting the wolves had a sweet tooth! They were clearly enjoying dessert,” said Sillero, a professor at Oxford University. Now, after observing the wolves drink nectar for the past few decades, Sillero and his colleagues believe the despite their meat-heavy diet. NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts at the lunar south pole, has hit a new snag. The agency said this week that the Artemis III mission and its historic planned lunar landing have been pushed from 2026 to mid-2027. Meanwhile, Artemis II, designed to fly four astronauts around the moon and originally expected to lift off in September 2025, must wait until April 2026 at the earliest for launch. The delay is partly due to issues with the Orion crew capsule’s heat shield, which was during the uncrewed Artemis I mission in 2022. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump announced tech billionaire and spaceflight trailblazer Jared Isaacman as his pick for NASA administrator, and it’s . The remains of an 18-month-old boy who lived 13,000 years ago in what’s now Montana have helped researchers gain insights into the diet of the ancient Clovis people, who were the ancestors of Native Americans. The toddler was still nursing at the time of death, which enabled scientists to determine more about his mother’s diet. She largely and other big game, suggesting the Clovis, who followed mammoth migration routes, were able to hunt the giants. Separately, archaeologists working at a Wyoming site unearthed 32 needle fragments fashioned around the same time the young boy lived. The small tools were likely responsible for helping the Clovis, who lived toward the end of the last ice age, create game-changing, tailored garments warm enough to protect against the frigid elements.

In another day of high drama, Yoon avoided being ousted from office after members of his party left parliament and boycotted the vote. Just two remained inside while the one governing lawmaker who returned voted against the motion. Outside the main hall, opposition lawmakers could be heard shouting, “Go inside [the chamber]!” and calling them “cowards,” as large crowds outside the National Assembly demanded the president’s ousting. President Yoon has been facing intense pressure to stand down as leader, after his shock bid to declare martial law in South Korea. The failed attempt – which would have been for the first time in over four decades that the law was enacted – sparked fierce backlash. Opposition lawmakers have submitted another motion for Wednesday, December 11 – the next available date they can vote on Yoon’s impeachment. Despite largely coming together to scupper Yoon’s impeachment, the governing People Power Party (PPP), of which the president is a member, insists he must quit. PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said his party will “continue to push for the president’s orderly resignation” in order to “minimize confusion.” An opposition lawmaker Kim Joon-hyung, of the Rebuilding Korea Party, said there was no way the president could last until the end of his term. “The sooner that he resigns or impeached, the better for our country.” Yoon earlier apologized to the nation Saturday in his first public comments since his abortive attempt to impose martial law threw the country into political chaos and led to calls for his impeachment. “This emergency martial law declaration stemmed from my desperation as the ultimate responsible party for state affairs,” Yoon said in a two-minute address. “I am deeply sorry and sincerely apologize to the citizens who must have been greatly shocked,” Yoon said, acknowledging that he “caused anxiety and inconvenience” to South Korean citizens. Yoon said he “will not avoid the legal and political responsibility related to this martial law declaration.” The furor began late Tuesday night, when Yoon declared martial law in an unannounced television address, accusing the main opposition party of sympathizing with North Korea and of “anti-state activities.” He cited a motion by the Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, to impeach top prosecutors and reject a government budget proposal. Yet within just six hours, the leader was , after lawmakers forced their way past soldiers into parliament to unanimously strike down the decree. Addressing rumors on Saturday that martial law will be invoked again, Yoon said “there will absolutely be no second attempt at a constitutional amendment.” “I will entrust my party with methods to stabilize the political situation, including the remainder of my term… I apologize to the citizens for the concerns I have caused,” Yoon concluded as he stepped off the podium and bowed. The declaration of a military emergency, although short-lived, was across the country, which remains by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it won a long, bloody fight for democracy in the 1980s. Pressure on Yoon has mounted in the days since, with protesters and opposition figures demanding his impeachment – and support wavering even and the military. On Friday, Han said Yoon needed to be from duty to protect the country from “grave danger.” Yoon’s apology came as new details emerged of the arrest list the president came up with during the upheaval, a significant turning point that prompted Han to call for Yoon’s suspension. Shortly after martial law was declared, Yoon allegedly told Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, over the phone that he should take the opportunity to “arrest and clean everything up.” Yoon said he would give the intelligence service authority to launch a counter-intelligence probe and “support it with funds, personnel unconditionally.” Details were first revealed to reporters by lawmakers briefed about the phone conversation, and Hong on Saturday confirmed to CNN the veracity of the content. Hong learned of the list through Defense Counterintelligence Command (DCC) later and thought it was “crazy,” lawmakers said earlier, citing him. Han was on the arrest list together with a raft of politicians including opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

During a recent interview with CNN, Lil Jon talked about what led to his focus on well-being. The acclaimed producer said he was going through a divorce a few years ago and facing a milestone birthday, when a friend helped him move beyond the personal meditations he would do each morning on the deck of his home by encouraging him to make some meditation music. The result was his “Total Meditation” album, which he said folks were initially skeptical about. “Some people were like, ‘What is this gonna sound like? Is he gonna be yelling?’” Lil Jon said, laughing. “Once it came out and people heard people were like, ‘Okay, this is actually pretty good.’ And I got so many messages of people telling me how they never meditated and how I helped them to meditate, or how specific songs helped them to deal with issues in their lives.” For his second album, the now 52-year-old artist included some of his personal affirmations in tracks on “Manifest Abundance Affirmations for Personal Growth.” He is happy to use his influence as a hip-hop star to get out the message of better health, especial to men of color, like him. “It’s a journey that I’m on. I have probably still like five more albums worth of stuff that we didn’t drop yet. It is a priority to me,” he said. “Mental health is an extreme priority to me because, you know, Black men, we’re taught to just suck it up and hold it in. I’m trying to give people options of how to deal with their mental stress.” Lil Jon has also dropped a remix of his 2002 hit for a special reason, partnering with Cologuard - the at-home colon cancer screening kit - to advocate for early disease detection. “Where I am in my life right now with mental health being a priority, physical health being a priority, when they reached out about me working with the Cologuard tests, I was like, 100 percent,” he told CNN. “I got a colonoscopy about two years ago. Mine was clean. I probably would’ve used the Cologuard test if I had really known about it.” From raising health awareness to bringing the hits, Lil Jon remains a trailblazer as one the first hip-hop producers to have a residency in Las Vegas, work that he’s still doing. When it comes to any of his work, he wants it to be fun. That’s what, he said, he brought to the “If Lil John, the guy known for partying is talking about this it might cause people to say let me check this out,” he said. “To help bring awareness and to push people that probably might not have checked out the Cologuard test before to check it out, I think is paramount.” “You gotta get low to take a number two to screen for colon cancer. So yeah, it is just making it fun and lighthearted for a serious thing that’s sometimes hard to talk about.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Joseph Kenny, New York Police Department chief of detectives, provided new details on this timeline Friday. Each moment is attributed to Kenny unless otherwise noted. The suspect arrives in New York at the Port Authority bus terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue via a bus that originated in Atlanta, then gets into a cab that takes him to the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, where he stays about half an hour. The suspect takes another cab to a hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave. on the Upper West Side. The suspect checks out of the hostel. “It’s not your traditional check in, check out. It’s the kind of thing where if you don’t show up at a certain time, they automatically just check you out,” Kenny said. “We don’t believe that he went someplace else. It’s more of an administrative checkout.” The suspect checks back into the hostel. United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson arrives in New York, Kenny said in a press conference on Wednesday. The suspect leaves the hostel, possibly by bike. He is seen wandering around the vicinity of the New York Hilton Midtown, on Sixth Avenue between West 53rd and 54th Streets, and goes back and forth for a bit before heading toward a Starbucks. “We have him wandering around, walking in the vicinity of hotel, walking on 54th Street, walking back and forth,” Kenny said. Images from Starbucks show the suspect buying a bottle of water and two energy bars roughly 30 minutes before the shooting, according to a law enforcement official. Surveillance video near a deli on West 55th Street appears to show the suspect walking and briefly stopping by a pile of trash. Around 6:30 a.m., surveillance video captures what appears to be the gunman on the phone. Thompson, the victim, walks toward the Hilton after leaving his hotel across the street, police said. The masked gunman is outside the hotel as Thompson makes his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference, according to New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The gunman comes up behind Thompson and shoots him in the back, Kenny said. He then walks toward Thompson and continues to shoot, stopping to clear a gun jam before firing again. Investigators told CNN that after the shooting, the assailant crosses the street from the Hilton, flees northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street, and gets on an electric bike on 55th Street before heading north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park. Patrol officers from Midtown North Precinct respond to a 911 call of a person shot in front of the Hilton on the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), between West 53rd Street and West 54th Street, police said. Officers arrive and find Thompson on the sidewalk in front of the hotel with gunshot wounds to his back and leg. He is taken to the hospital by EMS. The suspect is seen riding an electric bike into Central Park at 60th Street, according to Kenny. The suspect rides out of the park. He is seen on the bike at 85th Street and Columbus Avenue. He is no longer on the bike and is heading northbound on 86th Street. The suspect gets into a cab. Thompson is pronounced dead at the hospital, police say. The suspect is seen near the George Washington Bridge and a Port Authority bus terminal off 178th Street. Video shows him entering the station. “We don’t have any video of him exiting, so we believe he may have gotten on a bus,” Kenny said. NYPD investigators find a backpack in Central Park that they believe belonged to the suspect, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators have yet to officially confirm the origin of the bag and are taking it to be forensically tested at a lab in Queens, the source said. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

When Linda Thomas found out she needed a kidney transplant, didn’t hesitate. “There wasn’t a conversation,” Thomas told CNN. “She raised her hand right away and she said, ‘she got one right here.’ That was the only conversation.” Thomas was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2022 and went through the medical wringer to get better. The cancer went into remission, but her kidneys took a beating. After several medical tests, the sisters found they were a match across all markers and were more than 99% identical — a shockingly rare occurrence, even among twins. Because of the match, Thomas was not required to take anti-rejection drugs before the procedure.

About 23 billion pairs of shoes are produced globally every year, which means an annual carbon footprint of about 700 million tons of carbon dioxide. That’s a serious environmental concern, and a is trying to stomp it out. Recycling shoes isn’t easy because there are so many different components and materials, but the founders of FastFeetGrinded found a way. Shoes are sorted and the different components that make up a shoe — like rubber, foam and plastic — are separated by machines using heat and friction. Those materials are then shredded into small pieces before being separated by type and then refined into recycled materials ready for reuse. The foam, rubber and textile granules are then sold to manufacturers to be made back into items such as shoe parts, yoga mats, or flooring for playgrounds and outdoor sports centers. Currently, the company processes about 3,000 shoes an hour, and up to a million per year.

It was a brutal, unforgiving assault that left the US Pacific Fleet in ruins and the memory of that day seared into history as, in , “a date which will live in infamy.” Kohler had disobeyed direct orders to shelter in a ditch and remain in place. Instead, he ran to retrieve ammunition. Armed and determined, he and his comrades fought fiercely to repel the second wave of Japanese bombers attacking Ford Island. “Maybe (I was) a dumb farm boy, but I know this is the beginning of that war that they’d been talking about and waiting for, and I know that if I’m going to lose my life here, I don’t want to lose it in that ditch,” Kohler, a Minnesota farm boy turned sailor, said in an interview recorded . “I’m going to want my family and my country to know I died fighting, not hiding.” Before joining the Navy, Kohler was the son of a sharecropping dirt farmer and the fourth of 10 children. There was so much work to do that there was no time for hobbies besides hunting and helping put food on the table, he told CNN in an interview. But when he turned 17, he voluntarily enlisted into the Navy because he felt it was right for him to be there. “I had learned early in life that you never run from a challenge or fight, you always run to it. You can’t beat them by running from them,” Kohler told CNN. “If I am to be considered a representative of people of my generation as I’ve tried to be for all those that were lost at Pearl Harbor, I hope I have done it in a way that will have made them proud and brought to them the well-deserved honor and continued remembrance that they so rightfully deserve.” Now 100 years old, the veteran is believed to be one of only 16 Pearl Harbor survivors who are still alive, Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, confirmed to CNN.

We, the Sons and Daughters, will carry on with your history with pride.” At least two survivors – Ken Stevens and Ira “Ike” Schab Jr. – are expected to attend the Pearl Harbor Remembrance ceremony in Oahu, according to which manages the USS Arizona Memorial. Schab, 104, was greeted by the US Pacific Fleet Band and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Honor Guard upon his arrival at the Daniel K.

Initially, Schab did not want to return to the island because of how painful the memory was, his family told . But years ago, after seeing the number of remaining survivors slowly dwindle, Schab changed his mind. “He said, ‘As long as I’m able to make the trip, I want to make the trip for the people that can’t make the trip,’” his son, Karl Schab, told Hawaii News Now. On the morning of the attacks, Schab was a musician in the Navy band aboard the USS Dobbin and had just finished his shower and sat down for his coffee, his daughter said on their GoFundMe page. He was waiting for his younger brother Allen, who was visiting, so they could explore Honolulu together. But they never got to meet up that morning – and when the attacks began, Schab immediately started feeding ammunition to the gunners. More than anything else that day, Schab remembers “being scared,” he told Hawaii News Now. “Wondering about my brothers. Where they were.” The attack occurred around 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning, 353 Japanese planes, 35 submarines and two battleships. More than were destroyed. The air was thick with smoke and the acrid scent of burning oil and metal. Ships, once proud and sturdy, were ripped apart by torpedoes and bombs, sending massive plumes of fire and debris into the air. The US battleships, anchored in the harbor, were struck with such force that their hulls buckled and split open, flames engulfing the decks in a blinding inferno. Bodies of sailors, soldiers and airmen were thrown into the water, some burned beyond recognition, others left floating in the oily sea. The air was filled with the shrieks of men in agony, the crackle of machine gun fire, and the thunderous explosions that shook the ground. Nearby, Kohler was in an airplane hangar, right in the center of Pearl Harbor, writing a letter to his mother on a typewriter when he heard an approaching aircraft continue to get closer and closer. “Suddenly and almost simultaneously there was this tremendous roar and bomb fragments and window glass came crashing into the back of my head, ears, neck and shoulders,” Kohler said during the interview published . Despite being threatened to be reported for disobeying his officer’s direct orders to stay sheltered in the ditch, Kohler kept running. He grabbed a 50-caliber machine gun and ammunition and helped shoot at attacking warplanes. “What affected me the most was seeing those ships explode, capsize, and knowing that with every one of those events there were a lot of lives being lost,” Kohler said. Kohler is not in Hawaii. Instead, he will be speaking at the annual Beacon lighting ceremony held by conservation nonprofit Save Mount Diablo in California to pay tribute to the lives that were lost and honor surviving veterans. The Beacon on Mount Diablo was installed and illuminated in 1928 to aid in transcontinental aviation. But it was extinguished during the West Coast blackout following the Pearl Harbor attack out of fear it may lead to an attack on California. It stayed dark until Pearl Harbor Day in 1964, when Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces during World War II, relit the Beacon in a commemorative ceremony and suggested it be illuminated every December 7th to honor those who served and sacrificed. “In my way of thinking it gives the few survivors that are left an opportunity to reach back across the miles and the years and reconnect once again with our sunken shipmates and fallen comrades,” Kohler told CNN. Kohler says he believes that if those who were lost there that day had a voice of their own, they would say, “Remember us.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

At 10, he joined El Sistema, a globally acclaimed program providing free classical music training to children from under-resourced communities. “I fell in love with music from my first class,” he said. By 14, he was teaching classes; by 16, he was conducting. Eventually, Alvarez worked for El Sistema to help spread their innovative teaching methods worldwide. It was this work that led him to first visit Sweden in 2015. Alvarez was in Stockholm just as unprecedented numbers of refugees were arriving in the country, most from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He was struck by their plight and wanted to help. After moving to Gothenburg the following year, he created a music group for refugees and started with 13 students. He knew playing music together would help them make friends, express themselves, and rebuild their self-esteem. He named the group the to emphasize their potential. Eight years later, the program has more than 300 members, from 3 to 56 years old, of more than 25 nationalities. While many are immigrants and refugees, the group also includes many second-generation immigrants as well as native Swedes. “When somebody makes that decision to go into treatment, it’s one of the biggest decisions, the bravest decisions, they’ll make.” In 2011, when Knight was 51 years old, he had lost everything to meth addiction – his family, his job, his home, and nearly his life. HIV positive and living out of his car, Knight entered rehab at the behest of his mother. Eight months into recovery, Knight answered the door of his sober living apartment to find a friend in tears. She had relapsed, and in her arms was a 15-pound Maltese/Dachshund mix named Jayde. Knight’s friend said no one would take Jayde, and she asked Knight for a ride to a shelter so she could surrender her. Instead, Knight became a dog dad to Jayde. He soon learned that other people struggled to find temporary homes for their beloved pets when they needed to enter rehab, often delaying or forgoing substance abuse treatment because of it. Today, Knight and his organization, , provide foster care for pets while their owners are in rehab. They vet applicants, conduct animal behavior assessments, and execute contracts that require participants to stick to their recovery plan and complete a 12-month post-release wraparound program. His nonprofit has helped more than 1,200 dogs and their owners. “Talent and resilience and resourcefulness is so equally distributed worldwide, but opportunity is not.” A marketing major, McGriff was pursuing her dream job in business when she took an entrepreneurship class her senior year at the University of Idaho. Tasked with creating a business or nonprofit, she remembered reading that many impoverished families who want to educate their daughters can’t afford tuition fees, school supplies, and the uniform mandated in many countries. She connected with her professor, who encouraged her to join a spring break trip to his home country of Togo. There, she saw first-hand the reality of what girls faced and sought solutions. “A uniform is typically one of the more expensive pieces,” McGriff said. “They can be one of the most cost-effective ways to keep girls in school.” Ultimately, McGriff founded , known as SHE. In their first year, the group hired local seamstresses in Togo and provided uniforms and school fees to 65 girls. But the girls quickly outgrew their uniforms. That problem led to her team’s creation of ‘the uniform that grows.’ Designed by the seamstresses – with input from the students, McGriff, and others – the dress now has adjustable elements that create a tailored fit for every body type and enable it to grow up to a foot in length. The uniform can fit a girl for up to three years, adjusting six sizes; when outgrown, it can be handed down to younger girls. Today, SHE provides 1,500 girls a year in Togo with free uniforms, school fees, supplies, tutoring, and much more, while also bringing opportunities and education to the women they employ. “They’ve already been through so much trauma, it can be jarring when they arrive here and realize that it’s really just beginning.” As an immigration lawyer who works closely with unaccompanied migrant children, Rutter knows how long and difficult their journeys are and the desperate situations they are fleeing. Early on, she saw the hurdles her young clients had to overcome after arriving in the US. They lacked stable housing and consistent meals and needed mental health and academic support. “I saw that these kids don’t just need legal status, they also need all of these other things if they’re going to really heal and be successful,” Rutter said. Compelled to fill in those gaps, she created in 2015. The nonprofit provides free legal representation, essential and social services, and newcomer support programs to immigrant youth. The organization has assisted more than 1,100 individuals, representing more than 90 young people in immigration cases. Through their Immigrant Children’s Defense Project, Rutter and her group protect vulnerable youth across Pennsylvania, helping them apply for immigration status and representing in court those who are facing deportation. “I just started to wonder about a world where the benefits that you get from dance can lead to the outcomes that we’re looking for in STEM.” Growing up, Toussaint had a love for math but says the dance studio was her “home away from home.” This dual passion led her to study mechanical engineering at MIT, where she was also head of the dance team. She noticed that she was one of only two Black women in her major. Later, while teaching high school math, she became determined to empower girls of color to get excited about science, technology, engineering, and math. In 2012, she created , a nonprofit program that combines dance with STEM education to make these subjects more engaging and accessible. Today, the program works with girls of color ages 8 to 18 in nine cities across the US and is free to its participants. The organization’s school and summer programs typically attract girls who identify as dancers but are hesitant about STEM. Through the supportive community and hands-on projects, the girls begin to see themselves as programmers, engineers, and innovators. “Through dance, we’re able to create this atmosphere that feels comfortable,” Toussaint said. “And with that space, we’re able to introduce something that feels kind of intimidating.” Working in small groups, the girls choreograph dance routines that include STEM elements, such as LED light strips that they code to light up with the music. The girls also create songs through computer science that they incorporate into their performance. To date, more than 2,000 girls have benefitted from the program. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Here’s how to make this season fulfilling", "description": "For those who are single or estranged from family, the holidays can be hard. Here’s how to shift your mindset and create your own celebrations.", "language": "en", "datePublished": "2024-12-07T18:00:42.942Z", "dateModified": "2024-12-07T18:00:42.942000+00:00", "content": ". While is often a time rich with cheer, sentiment, love and family connections, it can also be a painful reminder of what once was or what many other people have but you don’t. “We’re shown this ideal version of the holidays, with partnered people, , people with families in the matching pajamas with the gorgeous photos,” said Shani Silver, a New Orleans-based writer, podcaster and author of the Substack newsletter . But that notion excludes a massive number of people who won’t have “the cozy Norman Rockwell Christmas,” she added, including those who are newly single or estranged from family, or have lost a partner or other family member. If you’re troubled by your situation, it’s OK to honor your feelings and keep the celebrations low-key or sit this holiday season out, experts say. But you don’t have to refuse to celebrate because you’re without a partner or family. This could be the holiday season in which you feel empowered to create new meaningful experiences with friends or the VIP in your life who is always there for you — yourself. Here’s how to figure out what’s best for you this holiday season. Not having a partner or close family to spend the holidays with can bring guilt, shame and blame, said Dr. Ayanna Abrams, an Atlanta-based clinical psychologist. You don’t have the life you’re “supposed” to have during this season, “and all of that exacerbates (your) feelings of loneliness and sadness,” she said. You can still be filled with grief, especially if a breakup, estrangement or death was recent, Abrams added. “All of a sudden everything is different this year,” she said, and you may be longing for the traditions you had with the person you lost. In such a transition, there’s no requirement to have the holidays look or feel the same as they always have, said Dr. Adam Brown, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at The New School for Social Research in New York. Just as there is nothing wrong with not having these things, there is also nothing bad about wanting and missing them. But there comes a point when dwelling in sadness or shame keeps you from motivating yourself to chart your own path forward and from recognizing the loving people remaining in your life. Silver encourages single people to “stop viewing your holiday season as a consolation prize.” Your holiday season isn’t insignificant, said Silver, who has been single for 17 years. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t get to celebrate as fully as anyone else, and “a home with one person in it is still full,” she said. “Each individual human being on Earth is a valid person.” When you’re considering other ways to celebrate the holidays, think about what brings the most joy, Silver said. “We have this unique time available to us to define what we want to do as individuals, and a lot of people will never have that,” she added. “Not viewing it as a burden, but viewing it as a benefit, is one of the ways that you can start to really enjoy this time.” If you always went to holiday markets or drive-through Christmas light shows with your ex, you can enjoy those activities alone or with friends, Silver said. Did your ex hate ice skating while you always wanted to try it? Now’s the time. Try doing some holiday baking, watching a movie at home or in a theater, going to a wine tasting or pop-up holiday experience, or cooking a recipe you’ve been eyeing forever. You can still put up a tree and mail out holiday cards, Abrams said. Drive or walk through beautifully decorated neighborhoods or travel to visit a friend. If you have friends or acquaintances in the same boat as you, get together for a holiday dinner like Silver did last year, or for other plans. You might feel like you don’t want to be a burden. But you never know what might happen if you tell a loved one that you’re feeling the need for connection and wondering what they’re doing for the holidays, Brown said. Maybe you’re sad about not having anyone leave you gifts under the tree, but you can do holiday shopping for things you’ve really wanted or organize a gift exchange among friends. To keep the element of surprise, Silver used to order themed mystery gift boxes or Advent calendars she’d wait until Christmas Day to open. For those shopping in person, some bookstores wrap books in paper and write a description on the exterior so you don’t know what you’re getting. Silver also focuses on gifting herself intangibles, such as knocking out work projects early to have more time off. Working with a therapist is one of the best ways to cope with struggles you may have during the season or other times of year, Abrams said. She recommended , if needed, to get ahead of office closures. That’s especially true if you’re noticing any isolation, excessive sleep, trouble getting out of bed, substance misuse or loss of appetite. Sometimes distractions are necessary, experts said. You can’t always avoid the pain or eliminate it, but you can learn to tolerate and hold space for it, Abrams said. Self-care can help you cope and experience more joy this year, Brown said. Do what helps you feel good and process your feelings, including exercising, journaling, talking things out in a voice recording, nourishing your body and using your support system. When considering whether to join the festivities, many people tend to think in all-or-nothing patterns: You either go to all the holiday parties or none. You deck all the halls of your house or leave everything bare. “We usually take away a lot of opportunities to have some semblance of something we want to experience,” Abrams said. Considering the middle ground can help — maybe you don’t go to a gathering but still send a white elephant gift. Or plan on attending but only staying for an hour or so. Try decorating, but maybe just one room. If grief strikes, stepping into another room or outside to cry, for example, is better than trying to repress emotion, Abrams said. Whether external or self-imposed, the pressure to just cheer up can make people feel a lot worse. (Cold air, though uncomfortable at first, can also be good for your mood, she said.) “You’re feeling this way because you are human,” she said. If seeing all the happy, romantic holiday posts feels too difficult, taking a break from social media or muting certain accounts may help, Abrams said. Shifting your mindset and how you compare yourself with someone else, on the other hand, may be in order, Silver said. “Being jealous is just one lens that you can choose,” she said. “You can also choose to see it as, ‘If it happened to them, it can happen to me.’” And if anyone asks nosy questions about your relationship status at a social gathering, you don’t owe them an answer, Silver said. You are just as worthy of dignity, respect and privacy as someone in a relationship. Preparing loose scripts of answers based on your boundaries and social dynamics can be useful, Abrams said, especially if you feel pressure to answer despite your feelings. You might say you don’t want to discuss it, that this season things are different or you just want to focus on the new. You could even preemptively let loved ones know via a text or phone call, which can save everyone an awkward moment. Regardless of what you do, Silver said she hopes you have as happy a holiday as anyone else — and urges you to choose the holiday season plans that you have the emotional bandwidth to handle. “Any way that you authentically want to spend the holidays is correct,” she said. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The boys, 6-year-old Roman Mendez and 5-year-old Elias Wolford, are being treated at a local hospital and have a “very long road ahead of them in terms of recovery,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a Thursday news conference. Mendez sustained two gunshot wounds and Wolford was shot once in the abdomen Wednesday, the sheriff said. Both suffered internal injuries and will undergo “a number of surgeries,” Honea said. They underwent surgery Friday. A sizeable crowd gathered in Oroville, with speakers offering religious-themed words of comfort. “Tonight we’re going to pray for Roman Mendez and Elias Wolford and we are going to pray for these families that have experienced a horrible, evil attack,” said Butte County Sheriff’s Office Chaplain Kenny Malone as people gathered around a holiday tree. The suspect, named by authorities Thursday as 56-year-old Glenn Litton, was found dead at the scene from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is assisting with the investigation. Officials say he appeared to﻿ have targeted the school and used a meeting with administrators to gain access to the campus. As students huddled in the school gym Wednesday, just feet away from the shooter standing outside, one student said she tried to keep the others calm by sharing words of encouragement. The attack at the tiny Feather River Adventist School in Oroville is another example of the scourge of gun violence on American campuses, with recorded so far this year in the United States. Guns are the for children in the US. “I told the kindergartners to take deep breaths and just think of something happy,” sixth grader Jocelyn Orlando told . “I told the little graders to close their eyes and cover their ears because he was pacing back and forth from the window.” Feather River Adventist School is a private school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade and has an enrollment of about 35 students, according to the sheriff. The school is affiliated with the , part of the Protestant Christian denomination whose followers believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and in the second coming of Christ. Followers worship on Saturdays and promote a healthy lifestyle. In a statement, a communications director with the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists said they were “deeply saddened” by the incident. “Join us as we lift up these children and their families in prayer,” the statement said. “We are grateful for the brave officers of the Butte County Sheriff’s Department who acted quickly to protect our students.” Authorities were working to determine why the suspect targeted the school and whether he was acting alone, Honea said. Litton is described as homeless and a convicted felon, legally prohibiting him from possessing a firearm, Honea said. He spent his time between Sacramento and the Chico area, had a lengthy criminal history and record of mental health issues, according to the sheriff. Authorities had received information on Wednesday leading them to believe the suspect had targeted the school because of its affiliation with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Honea said. Before the shooting Wednesday, the suspect had attended a meeting with a school administrator, ostensibly to explore the possibility of enrolling a family member, the sheriff said. The meeting was described as “cordial,” he said. No concerns were raised at the time and Honea said Thursday the meeting appeared to be a ruse for the suspect to gain access to the campus. Litton attended a Seventh-day Adventist School near San Diego when he was a “young man,” and may have had a relative attend the school he targeted many years ago, the sheriff said. However, authorities have not determined a “current connection” between Litton and the school in Oroville, he said. Investigators were examining material written by the suspect that appeared to conflate American involvement in conflict in the Middle East with the church, Honea said. Litton was first imprisoned in 1991 for theft and subsequently convicted of crimes including theft, fraud and forgery, Honea said. The Butte County Sheriff’s Office has not had any contact with Litton since he was booked into the county jail for forgery and fraud charges in 2003, the sheriff said. Most recently, Litton was a suspect in the theft of a U-Haul pickup truck in Chico after he did not return the rental to the company, which reported it stolen to police, Honea said. After he was located inside the stolen U-Haul truck, the sheriff said Litton was arrested on November 12 by the South San Francisco Police Department on an outstanding burglary warrant in San Bernardino County and fresh charges of being in possession of a forged license. Litton was then booked into the San Mateo County Jail and transferred to the county jail in San Bernadino. The fake license had a photo of Litton along with a fraudulent name that he also used to make appointments to meet with officials at the school he targeted, Honea said. On November 21, Litton was released by the court on his own recognizance after he pleaded not guilty. He was then picked up by a family member and taken back to Sacramento, Honea said. On Wednesday morning, Litton was in the vicinity of a motel in the Chico area, where he had been staying for a few nights at various motels, the sheriff said. He took a bus to Oroville, arriving around 8:30 a.m. and carrying a large duffel bag, he added. Under another alias, Litton then called an Uber and was dropped off at the school campus just after noon, Honea said. Litton’s meeting with the school principal centered around “what it would take for him to enroll his grandson in the school,” Honea said. He made up a fake story that his daughter moved to the area and wanted his grandson to attend the school, the sheriff said, as a ruse to set up an appointment to gain access to the campus after the meeting. Outside surveillance footage shows Litton with his hand inside his jacket, near his waistband, where he was concealing his firearm, the sheriff said. Children at the school were finishing up their noon break and were heading back to the classroom when Litton pulled out the firearm and initiated the attack, the sheriff said. Within two minutes, a state highway patrol officer had arrived at the school, where a handgun was found near the body of the suspected shooter, he said. Several minutes later, sheriff’s deputies arrived on campus and officers provided first aid to the two wounded students, Honea added. Once the scene was secured, the remaining students were taken by bus to a nearby church to be reunited with their parents, the sheriff said. Sixth grader Jocelyn’s father expressed his concerns about the shooting and the safety of his children attending a private school saying, “the presumption is that it’s the safest place a parent can send their child.” Law enforcement agencies across the state were urged to “be vigilant” and ensure schools associated with the church are safe, Honea added. “Whether or not this is a hate crime or whether or not it’s part of some sort of larger scheme at this point, I don’t have enough information to provide an answer to that,” Honea said. According to , there are about 1.2 million Seventh-day Adventist members in the United States and Canada combined, and nearly . There are more than 7,500 Seventh-day Adventist schools worldwide enrolling more than 1.8 million students. The lead pastor of the Oroville Church of the Nazarene, Travis Marshall, told CNN the reunification process between children and parents at the church continued through Thursday morning and was “very emotional.” The church received the first call from the sheriff’s office around 1:30 p.m., and 10 church representatives, along with dozens of county sheriffs came to the church to assist with reunification, according to Marshall. “A lot of outbursts, praise and tears,” Marshall said. “A lot of hugging going on. Yesterday was one of those events where you get a shared sense of humanity.” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told the news conference his office was assisting the students and their families. The community announced plans for a Monday to raise money for the families. The co-founder and co-CEO of , Nicole Hockley, said, “An attack such as this goes against everything we stand for as a nation,” in a statement following the shooting. Hockley’s 6-year-old son Dylan was killed in the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “In the wake of this shocking and senseless act, our hearts are with these two precious children and their families as they begin a long road ahead dealing with their trauma. We wish them strength and stand with them in solidarity, demanding answers as to why and how this happened,” Hockley said. CNN’s Kia Fatahi contributed to this report.

But it was Hegseth, then a Fox News personality, whose opinion Trump really wanted. Hegseth, now Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of defense, had been a vocal and persistent advocate for veterans having unfettered access to private health care, rather than having to go through the VA to keep their benefits. He’s also lobbied for policies that would restrict VA care and believes veterans should ask for fewer government benefits. “We want to have full choice where veterans can go wherever they want for care,” Hegseth told Trump on speakerphone as Shulkin listened, according to Shulkin’s 2019 memoir. Trump’s pick to serve as the next VA secretary, Doug Collins, has also expressed support for greater privatization of veteran health care, which advocates characterize as giving veterans greater choice over their doctors. If veterans “want to go back to their own doctors, then so be it,” he last month. For Shulkin, a rare “holdover” from President Barack Obama’s administration to Trump’s, this was “the worst-case scenario” for veteran health care, and one he had repeatedly warned Hegseth against. “Your version of choice would cost billions more per year, bankrupting the system,” Shulkin recalls telling Hegseth in his memoir. “How can we responsibly pursue this? Unfortunately, he didn’t want to engage at the level of budget and other aspects of day-to-day reality. He seemed to prefer his sound bites on television.” If confirmed, Hegseth and Collins will have the opportunity to push for a dramatic overhaul of the military and veteran health care system, one that could significantly cut government health benefits for service members and veterans – many of which Hegseth says veterans should not be asking for at all. Veterans groups “encourage veterans to apply for every government benefit they can ever get after they leave the service,” he told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” in 2019. “To me, the ethos of service is, I served my country because I love my country and I’m gonna come home and start the next chapter of my life. If I’ve got a chronic condition – mental, physical, otherwise – the government better be there for me, but otherwise I don’t want to be dependent on that.” CNN has reached out to Hegseth and the Trump transition for comment on this story. The fight by pro-small government conservatives to privatize VA health care is not a new one, particularly as the VA has long been plagued with bureaucratic challenges, resulting in long wait times and sometimes dangerously delayed medical care for veterans. Hegseth told the “Shawn Ryan Show” podcast last month that he is not explicitly advocating for privatizing the VA, but rather “to effectively let the dollars follow the veteran” to their preferred doctor. Critics, though, say the “unfettered choice” narrative is a trojan horse for privatizing and ultimately dismantling the VA system altogether, whose budget was over $300 billion in 2024. Hegseth told Shawn Ryan that the VA “hates” conversations about more private options “because their budget might get reduced.” “It’s a typical swampy feedback loop,” he said. He added that when he was being considered for VA secretary in 2016, he heard from huge numbers of veterans who supported his ideas. But Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot who challenged Sen. Mitch McConnell for his seat in Kentucky in 2020, emphasized in a conversation with CNN that while the debate around privatization of care has been “going on for years,” there hasn’t been a “wide-spread outcry from veterans to privatize the VA.” “I’m not saying the VA is perfect, it’s certainly not,” McGrath, a Democrat, said. “But I don’t think there’s this huge outcry to privatize it.” A senior Biden administration official told CNN that within the VA, there are a number of career civil servants “who have dedicated their lives to the health and welfare of the veterans our nation has sent to war repeatedly.” Those civil servants are now deeply worried about “the continued health care and earned benefits of the veterans they serve,” the official added. As secretary of defense, Hegseth would oversee the Military Health System, which is separate from the Veterans Health Administration. But Hegseth is of government-provided health care, and has argued that health care benefits for both active duty service members and veterans should be cut significantly so that the Pentagon can spend more on “war-fighting capability,” according to a Wall Street Journal op-ed he wrote in 2014. “If this continues, the Defense Department will eventually be a health care and pension provider that also happens to fight wars,” he wrote. McGrath also said that while she understands the idea of trying to cut costs, there’s been no data “that shows me that privatizing it is going to cut costs significantly.” “Health care is expensive, no matter how you go about it,” she said. “And I fear, and I think a lot of people fear, you will lose quality of care, because now you’re switching over veteran care to the private sector, the private sector has an incentive to make money…health insurance makes money by denying care. Is that what we want?” As CEO of the veterans organization Concerned Veterans for America, a group backed by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, Hegseth only to veterans with service-connected disabilities and specialized needs. That policy would significantly restrict the number of future veterans eligible for VA care at all. Hegseth’s skepticism of the wide array of government benefits veterans have at their disposal has prompted outrage from veterans’ groups. Max Rose, an Army Reserve officer and Democratic former congressman who now serves as a senior adviser for progressive veteran organization VoteVets, called Hegseth’s remarks “massively disrespectful” to veterans, who have been trusted “to go to war, to protect the homeland, defend our rights, and our way of life – and then we think they will come home and be an abusers of health care services?” In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Shulkin said some of Hegseth’s ideas were not outlandish – he agrees that veterans should have some access to private care, particularly if VA wait times for an appointment are excessive. But he also said that Hegseth, as an outsider with no experience at the VA or in health care, didn’t understand the “complexities” of the system he was trying to completely reshape. “At the time, I was telling him, ‘I’m here on the ground, I know the reality,’” he told CNN in an interview on Wednesday. “I see the patients, the veterans with PTSD. I’ve been a doctor my whole life in the private sector. I know my hospitals that I ran didn’t have the capability to care for these patients. I’m not just going to give [veterans] a voucher and say, ‘Good luck.’” As Shulkin’s memoir demonstrates, Hegseth – and Concerned Veterans for America – has asserted significant influence over Trump on this issue. Trump considered tapping Hegseth for VA secretary in 2016, Hegseth told Ryan. By the time Trump took office, Hegseth had already stepped down from CVA amid reported accusations of financial mismanagement, frequent drunkenness and sexual harassment, all of which Hegseth denies. Still, CVA “was at the White House on a regular basis and showing up at meetings when I hadn’t invited them,” Shulkin wrote in his memoir. “At every turn, White House staff made sure CVA was given a strong voice.” The progressive government watchdog American Oversight CVA’s influence over Trump on this issue in the early years of his first administration. Kate Kuzminski, the director of the military, veterans, and society program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), said there is a conversation that could be had about moving some veteran health services – particularly those services that are not for things directly linked to military service – into communities and outside of the VA. For example, an annual check-up, or getting a regular vaccination shot. But, she said, it brings up more questions particularly about how veterans in vulnerable communities, like those with low income, could continue accessing care if the VA is no longer an option for them. “There is a potential for individuals who need access to care, either being delayed in accessing that or not being able to access it at all … and we as a nation have philosophically said, yeah, that is our responsibility,” Kuzminski said. When it comes to the military health system that the defense secretary directly oversees, the Pentagon this year began to re-evaluate its policy over the last decade of trying to reduce health care costs by cutting staff at military health facilities and outsourcing care to private doctors and hospitals. That move toward privatized care was making it harder for service members to access doctors because of staffing shortages at military facilities and the fact that TriCare, which allows troops and their families to access private doctors and clinics, was either not being accepted by many private providers or only allowed access to subpar facilities, a DoD inspector general report found last year. “I can appreciate that it sounds good to advocate for people to have the most freedoms and abilities to choose,” Shulkin said. “There’s no question that that’s an important part of health care. But you have to have a system you can send them to that knows how to deal with toxic exposures and post-traumatic stress, and the injuries that were happening to our young men and women who were coming back after IED explosions, and needed that type of complex prosthetic care.” Rose echoed the same concerns that veterans may not be able to get the kind of holistic care they may need from a civilian health provider. Problems with VA health services – of which there are examples of, “undeniably” – are “reason to build upon our existing system, not to decimate it.” “Being able to walk into an institution and speak to someone who understands not just the experience of combat, but the experience of just being in the military – a private health care facility couldn’t replace that,” Rose said. Kuzminski agreed there are issues the VA excels beyond civilian health care in treating, but said there has been “a lot of progress” in the last decade on electronic health records, which would allow military and civilian health providers to have a more well-rounded image of a veteran’s health care needs. Shulkin said that he will reserve judgment on Hegseth’s nomination until he sees him address the issues of service member and veteran care during his confirmation hearings. But he indicated that he hopes Hegseth’s views have changed. “I do believe that what any good leader needs to do is to be able to recognize when their opinions should change or need to change,” he said, “and then to be able to articulate and express what their vision for leading the agency actually is.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

Five different apartments were affected by the explosion, they said. Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen a car driving away from the scene at a very high speed shortly after the incident. Though the search began as a rescue operation, Jan van Zanen, mayor of The Hague said, by Saturday afternoon, it had turned into a recovery mission instead.

The Dutch Urban Search and Rescue service sent a rescue group to the scene on Saturday morning, including four dog handlers and a structural engineer. By 11:30 a.m. local time, the fire was nearly out and rescue dogs were searching for possible victims, firefighters said. The dogs could not search the building for long, however, because there was a risk that it could fully collapse, according to Dutch . Some 40 homes have been evacuated, it reported. One man told the broadcaster that his first thought upon seeing the aftermath of the explosion was that it was due to a rocket attack. He heard a child calling for help from the rubble, he said, but was unable to reach them when people pulled him back from the fire. Forensic officers were also at the scene collecting evidence, the broadcaster said. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a that he was “shocked” by images of the damaged apartment building, and that he has spoken with the mayor of The Hague to offer help.

He was reportedly 77. The news of his November 22 death was confirmed to on Friday by Withers’ daughter, Jessie Withers, who identified the cause as pancreatic cancer. The elder Withers enjoyed a prolific career in television throughout the ’80s – with appearances in shows including “Matlock,” “Magnum, P.I.,” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Dallas” and “L.A. Law” – but again drew attention in 2016 as coroner Gary in Season 1 of hit Netflix show “Stranger Things.” While he also played Coach Locke across eight episodes of daytime soap opera “Days of Our Lives,” Withers is most known for portraying Ted, boyfriend and confidante to Steven Carrington, prized son and heir of the titular family in the first season of “Dynasty,” in 1981. Playing an LGBTQ+ character on a major American TV show was a rare occurrence for an actor in a drama at the time. In 2018, Withers told the “ ” podcast that the “Dynasty” creators “were brilliant in pushing the envelope” in portraying an authentic gay relationship without overly adding scandal or humor. He said the relationship with Steven was “30, 40 years ahead of its time.” More recent roles for Withers came in shows such as “Frasier,” “Criminal Minds,” “Sense8,” “Castle” and “Drop Dead Diva.” Jessie Withers, in a statement to Variety, said of her father: “He confronted his illness with the same strength and dignity he brought to his craft, creating a legacy of warmth, humor, and d﻿edication, along with his remarkable ability to make every role unforgettable.

In a video released by the militant group Saturday, the hostage Matan Zangauker – who appears to be speaking under duress – describes the grim conditions of the Gaza tunnels where he is being held and criticizes the Israeli leader’s plan to offer a $5 million reward and safe passage to anyone returning one of the captives. CNN cannot verify when the video was taken, though it appears to be recent as Zangauker says he has been held for more than 420 days and Netanyahu’s announcement of the $5 million reward was made on November 29. In the video, Zangauker describes living with spiders and rats. He says he doesn’t have soap and is suffering from skin diseases. He says he hopes the people of Israel will not forget him and he hopes to see his family again soon. Zangauker’s family say they want the world to see the video because it is a “sign of life.” Zanguaker’s mother, Einav – who has previously criticized Netanyahu’s offer of the $5 million reward as “bribes” for the captors – on Saturday again called out the prime minister saying “the only way to bring (Matan) and everyone back is through a deal.” “The fact that Matan is alive today, doesn’t mean he’ll survive the winter or the ongoing military pressure,” a visibly shaken and tearful Einav Zangauker told the weekly rally in Tel Aviv. “Netanyahu – look my son in the eye, who has been dying in the tunnels for 14 months already – what if he were your son?” she said. In a message to her son, she cried, “My Matan! My life! Mom’s here and is waiting for you and fighting for your return and everyone’s return.” “If you hear me – hold tight! Know that we’re not stopping for a moment … stay strong.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also called on the government to pursue a deal, saying in a post on X he was “petrified” by the fact Matan was still there and calling on Netanyahu’s “government of destruction” to “wake up.” Netanyahu’s office said he had spoken with Einav Zangauker Saturday evening following the video’s release. It said the prime minister had told her “he fully understands the difficult suffering that Matan is going through” and that he is “acting fiercely and in every way to return Matan and all the hostages home - both the living and the dead.” Israeli authorities believe there are still 100 hostages being held in Gaza. Zangauker and his partner Illana Gritzewsky were taken from Nir Oz Kibbutz – one of several kibbutzim, or small farming enclaves, that bore the brunt of Hamas’ ground assault on October 7. Nir Oz lost a quarter of its small community to Hamas bullets and kidnappers. Gritzewsky was returned on November 30, 2023, as part of a short-lived hostage-ceasefire deal. She stood alongside Zangauker’s mother and sister Natalie at the rally Saturday. Speaking to Israel’s Channel 11, Gritzewsky said the video “took me back to (my) captivity. It didn’t give me any air, because I know that each moment can matter there, and the fact that he’s alive now doesn’t mean there will be life tomorrow or in five minutes. I saw his eyes with pain, with fear and uncertainty. I heard his voice crying out for help.” The latest video comes a week after Hamas released similar footage of the , who also criticized Netanyahu’s $5 million reward and called on US President-elect Donald Trump to help free the hostages. Zangauker’s mother has been highly critical of the reward offer, saying at the time it was made that the prime minister was “trading the hostages’ lives.” She criticized Netanyahu for “offering money to Hamas” and said his attempt to “divide and rule in Gaza through bribes to the captors” would put the hostages at risk. She has long been outspoken in calling for a deal to return the hostages, speaking weekly outside the Israel Defense Forces headquarters in Tel Aviv, as well as outside Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, at the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) and other locations. In the video released Saturday, Zangauker appears to acknowledge his mother’s efforts. “Mom, I’m watching you, and I’m hearing a lot about you, I am aware of the things you’re doing. I’m hearing about your activities. I am very happy to hear that you are fine. I hope to see you again soon, when we meet. I hope to sit with you again at the same table, eat with you, talk to you, drink with you,” he says. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Syrian rebels have made in the north of the country, taking two major cities: Aleppo, the second biggest city, and Hama, a strategically important city that lies on a vital supply route. The rebels are saying they’ll advance further south to Homs, just over 100 miles from the Syrian capital of Damascus. “When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,” , the former Al Qaeda fighter who is now leading the rebellion, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. While Assad has many enemies in the region and beyond, his fall wouldn’t be welcomed by all. Western and Arab states, as well as Israel, would like to see curtailed, but none wish for a radical Islamist regime to replace Assad. For Russia, Syria’s fall could mean losing its closest Middle Eastern ally and undermining its ability to project power while it fights a war in Ukraine. For Iran, it could shatter its so-called , comprising allied states and militias. Here’s how the events in Syria could impact key players in the Middle East: The rebel advances in Syria mark the first real test of powerful Arab states’ commitment to reconcile with Assad. At the height of the Syrian civil war, Sunni Arab states, including regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, broke ties with the Iran-allied Assad regime, and threw their weight behind opposition groups trying to topple it, seeing it as an opportunity to curb Tehran’s regional influence. But Assad, aided by Russia, Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, survived and reclaimed territory lost to the rebels. Under , Syria turned into what some experts have called a “ ,” fueling a . Syria’s prompted Arab nations to extend a hand to the Assad regime, and over the past few years, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have led efforts toward his regional and international rehabilitation. In 2023, the Syrian regime was readmitted to the Arab League. Over a decade after they backed the Syrian opposition, Gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are now siding with Assad as he once again faces a rebellion. “In 2011, a very large number of countries rather quickly came to the view that they would be better off if Assad fell and they wanted to get rid of him… but the Saudis, Emiratis and others in the region see this now as a challenging and destabilizing situation for them if Assad falls at this point,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute. In their annual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit last weekend, Gulf Arab leaders called for the preservation of Syria’s territorial integrity, declared respect for its sovereignty and rejected regional interference in its internal affairs. By contrast, the statement after the 2011 GCC summit called on Assad to “immediately stop the killing machine, put an end to the bloodshed and release detainees.” “We might see that many of these countries would want to take advantage of the situation to improve their own position inside Syria, particularly with Iran, but that necessitates that Assad is weakened but stays – a very different position from what they had earlier on when they were throwing everything at him to get rid of him all together,” Parsi said. Iran has used Syria to expand its regional influence through proxy groups stationed in the country. The , along with its most formidable proxy Hezbollah, have in keeping Assad in power, by helping Syrian government forces regain lost territory, while sending its own Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders to advise Assad’s military. After the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its attack on Israel in , Hezbollah began exchanging fire with Israel, prompting an Israeli retaliation that had the group’s top brass assassinated and significantly . As a result, Hezbollah pulled its forces out of Syria to focus on its war with Israel, leaving Assad exposed, experts said. In Syria, Israel has consistently and supply routes used to transfer weapons to its proxies. The fall of Aleppo and potentially other cities bordering Lebanon could further disrupt those routes, placing Iran in a difficult position. Last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the Qatari news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed that Tehran would consider sending troops to Syria if requested by the Assad regime. However, escalating the war in Syria could undermine Iran’s efforts to pursue diplomacy with the West and Arab states. Losing Syria would be “a huge blow” for Iran, Parsi said. “The in Syria is very significant, it’s an important land bridge to Lebanon, but also the alliance the Iranians have with the Assad regime has lasted across the Islamic Republic’s history.” Iran may also use as leverage in potential talks with an incoming Trump administration, Parsi said. “If Iran loses too much of their position in the region, will they be too weak to negotiate? But if they fight back to try and retain as much of that position as possible, do they risk escalating the war to the point where diplomacy may no longer be possible?” he said. “They’re walking a fine balance,” Israel too is caught in a difficult position. Assad, who views Israel as an enemy, has not posed a direct threat to the country, opting not to respond to the regular Israeli strikes in Syria over the past year. But the regime has allowed its territory to be used by Iran to supply Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hadi al-Bahra, a Syrian opposition leader representing anti-Assad groups, including the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), said rebels felt encouraged to make an advance for Aleppo last week after Israel debilitated Hezbollah and weakened Iran’s footprint in the region. “Due to the Lebanese war and decrease in Hezbollah forces, (Assad’s) regime has less support,” Al Bahra told Reuters in an interview, adding that Iran-backed militias also have fewer resources, and Russia is providing less air cover to Assad’s forces due to its . The group leading the rebellion, however, is Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) whose leader Abu Muhammad Al Jolani is a former al Qaeda fighter with an Islamist ideology that opposes Israel. “Israel is in between Iran, its proxies and Syria’s Islamic rebels,” Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, told CNN. “None of the choices are good as far as Israel is concerned but for the time being Iran and its proxies are weakened, which is good.” Israel has to make sure that the offensive will not evolve into a “new challenge” posed by HTS and the Sunni rebels leading the offensive in Syria, he added. Assad was on a losing streak in Syria until Russian President Vladimir . Without Russian air support, the recapture of Aleppo in 2016, a turning point for the embattled Syrian president, would have been difficult, if not impossible. The Kremlin said this week it will “certainly continue to support” Assad as Russian jets stepped up strikes on opposition forces in northern Syria. Nicole Grajewski, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with a focus on Russia, said the Assad regime was caught off-guard during the rebels’ latest offensive, and the rebels may have taken advantage of Russia’s distraction with Ukraine to take land in Syria. Moscow hadn’t committed a large number of forces to Syria and may still be capable of supporting it, she added, but Russia’s ability to mobilize forces would be difficult given how quickly the rebels are advancing across northern Syria. Overall, the rebels’ advance with the help of Turkey is a “pretty big threat to Russia,” Grajewski told CNN. “Russia put far too much capital in Assad and the loss of Syria would be an even bigger loss as its broader status as a great power and its ability to maneuver in the Middle East.” Turkey has tried to distance itself from the rebels’ actions in northern Syria, but it is the primary backer of the Syrian National Army, one of the groups pushing the offensive. Ankara has also represented the opposition in negotiations with Russia over several years in the past decade, which eventually led to between parties in Syria each of them supports. Despite its support for opposition forces, Turkey has not ruled out a rapprochement with Syria. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for a meeting with Assad, the man he once labeled a terrorist, to reset relations. Assad has refused to meet him as long as Turkey continues to occupy parts of his country. Turkey has also sought a solution for an estimated it hosts – more than any other country. The refugees have become a major point of contention in Turkey, often leading to anti-Syrian riots and calls for mass deportation by opposition parties. Until recently, the Syria situation was seen in Turkey as “regime is winning, opposition is losing” with the Iran-Russia axis defining the developments on the ground, said Galip Dalay, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London. But the recent rebel push has changed that power dynamic. “Now it’s clear that Turks want to engage in a negotiation but showing Assad that he is entering the negotiation from a point of weakness. If negotiations now take place, the only way it will lead to anything is if Assad provides real concessions, not cosmetic concessions,” Dalay told CNN. Another goal for Turkey is to push back Kurdish insurgent groups located along the Turkish-Syria border and create a buffer zone. Erdogan has long opposed Kurdish nationalism and made it clear that his ultimate goal is to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish far-left militant and political group based in Turkey and Iraq that has fought the Turkish state for more than three decades. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Trump, who is set to return to the White House in a little over six weeks, arrived in Paris at a pivotal moment for governments in Western Europe. The region, like France itself, is caught between a wavering liberal democratic order and the that aim to upend it. French President Emmanuel Macron, now in his second five-year term, seized on the occasion to hold a private meeting with Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The three eventually stood together for an uneasy-looking photo opportunity. Macron himself is striving to at home while retaining his influence abroad — most persistently when it comes to the future of Western support for Ukraine against Russia. Zelensky’s position is more perilous. Trump has insisted he has a plan to bring immediate peace to the region, though allies of Ukraine are concerned the president-elect might push for a ceasefire or peace deal viewed as more favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has signaled little interest in abandoning his war of conquest. Zelensky gave away little in a social media post after his sit-down with Trump and Macron, describing it as a “good and productive trilateral meeting.” “We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” Zelensky wrote on X, adding that “President Trump is, as always, resolute.” Macron welcomed Trump to the Élysée Palace ahead of the ceremony with the pair’s now-customary grappling handshake before the two briefly addressed reporters. “We had a good time together and we had … really great success working together on defense and offense, too,” Trump said of his first term. “And it certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now.” Macron called Trump’s visit “a great honor or French people” and recalled Trump’s response to the Notre Dame fire five years earlier. “You were at that time president, for the first time, and I remember the solidarity and your immediate action,” Macron said. “So welcome back again. We’re very happy to have you here.” The French president’s success in delivering Trump to Paris earned him some rare acclaim from the French press, which described it as a “diplomatic coup.” Macron, who was the first foreign leader to publicly congratulate Trump on his election last month, successfully put himself in a room with Trump and Zelensky for a closed-door meeting that lasted a little more than 30 minutes. The president-elect and Ukrainian leader last met weeks before the US election in New York for a conversation that Zelensky characterized as “warm, good, constructive.” The particulars of Trump’s visit to Paris were hashed out over several days, but the president-elect had told his team he was keen to attend as soon as the invitation arrived. He has a long-held fascination with the cathedral and even tweeted out in distress more than five years ago as a fire ravaged its Gothic edifice, which sits on the Île de la Cité, an island within Paris’ Seine River. Its iconic spire and roof were destroyed as television audiences around the globe watched in horror. Investigators believe the blaze was an accident but have not yet identified the direct cause. “So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,” Trump on April 15, 2019, during his first term in the Oval Office. “Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!” His suggestion was ignored by firefighters and the French civil security agency, Sécurité Civile, on social media less than two hours later, warning – in English – that “water-bombing aircrafts … could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.” Trump has long sought the kind of high-society recognition on offer this weekend from Macron and other European leaders anxious over the direction of the incoming administration, though some of his domestic critics — led by late-night comedians — mocked Trump before he left. “If all goes according to plan, he would like to buy it and turn it into a casino,” Jimmy Kimmel joked earlier this week. Jimmy Fallon quipped that the cathedral is “going to burst right back into flames” when Trump steps inside. For Macron, though, the occasion was nothing to scoff at. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, he pledged to rebuild and reopen the gutted cathedral in five years — a deadline he just about made. There is less room for error, and much more at stake, in his efforts to sustain the fragile coalition backing Ukraine. The US is the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine and critical to marshaling Western support for its defense. Trump, however, on the value of US aid to Ukraine and has repeatedly claimed the war would not have started if he had been president. Macron’s congratulations to the president-elect last month — going out before most US media agencies had even called the race — alluded to his relationship with Trump the first time he was in the White House, , although it didn’t last. “Congratulations, President . Ready to work together as we did for four years,” Macron wrote on X last month. “With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” Later that evening, he and Trump spoke by phone, Macron’s office said. The French president has made a fresh push to curry favor with the returning president and his allies. CNN has reported that Macron plans to invite Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, whom the president-elect has in his administration, to Paris for a summit on artificial intelligence in early February. Musk was also on hand for the ceremonies at Notre Dame. Trump also met with Prince William at the UK ambassador’s residence in Paris following the ceremony. “He’s doing a fantastic job,” Trump said of Prince William, calling the British heir to the throne a “good man.” First lady Jill Biden also attended the Notre Dame ceremony, wrapping up her last official state trip abroad, while President Joe Biden opted to stay in the US. The first lady did not, however, visit the Élysée Palace or attend any high-profile meetings. Saturday’s trip came a week after his selection of son-in-law Jared Kushner’s father, real estate developer Charles Kushner, to serve as the next US ambassador to France. Charles Kushner was after pleading guilty in 2004 to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission. Macron was not the first G7 leader to huddle with Trump since the election. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Florida and at Mar-a-Lago on November 29. Over dinner that night, Trump — during a discussion on his proposed tariffs — joked that Canada avoid any pain by becoming the 51st US state, two sources briefed on the conversation told CNN. “The president was teasing us,” Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who was seated at the same table, told reporters in Ottawa this week. “It was, of course, on that issue, in no way a serious comment.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The package, which includes more drones and ammunition for a critical rocket system, brings the total US security assistance to Ukraine to $62 billion since the war started nearly three years ago, a key component of keeping Kyiv in the fight. Russia has suffered more than 700,000 battlefield casualties since the war began, Austin said, and “squandered” more than $200 billion. The US has led a coalition of countries to arm and equip Ukraine’s military since February 2022, and Austin said it would be a mistake to abandon Kyiv. “This administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress,” said Austin. “The next administration must make its own choice.” Though the outgoing defense secretary did not mention Donald Trump by name, his arguments for American engagement internationally contrasted sharply with the president-elect’s promise of “America first.” Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the value of US aid to Ukraine, and Vice President-elect JD Vance has said in the past that Russia is not an existential threat to Europe. Austin’s message on the importance of aid to Ukraine came the same day Trump met Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in Paris before the reopening of Notre Dame. The two met in the Élysée Palace with French President Emmanuel Macron for just over an hour Saturday. Zelensky described it as a “good and productive trilateral meeting” in a post on social media afterward. “We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” he said, adding that “President Trump is, as always, resolute.” But key members of Trump’s incoming administration have questioned the value of foreign aid in general and military aid to Ukraine specifically. Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-chair of Trump’s commission to cut government spending, said he intends to examine whether foreign aid is worth the taxpayer dollars. “How does that actually advance a purpose that serves the US taxpayer in the best interests of the United States of America?” Ramaswamy asked rhetorically on C-SPAN last week. Austin argued that it is precisely this foreign engagement that helps preserve and uphold what he refers to as the rules-based international order. In a look back at his time as defense secretary, Austin highlighted increased US military cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, as well as new agreements with India and Australia. The US has also sent $13.6 billion in aid to Israel as part of nearly 400 cases of foreign military sales since its war against Hamas began just over a year ago, Austin said. “The world built by American leadership can only be maintained by American leadership,” the outgoing secretary said. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Global leaders and dignitaries , current US first lady Jill Biden, Elon Musk — the world’s richest man — and Britain’s Prince William joined French President Emmanuel Macron in a celebration that fused Catholic tradition with a dash of history and politics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who attended last-minute and met with Trump and Macron at the Elysee palace earlier in the day, was welcomed to the church with a standing ovation. Some 170 bishops from around the world and priests from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese were involved in the festivities, but Pope Francis did not attend. The pontiff instead sent a message, describing the cathedral’s reopening as a moment of “joy, celebration, and praise.” Inclement weather forced organizers to move the beginning of the service, which was supposed to take place on the redesigned forecourt in front of the cathedral, inside, where it was sheltered from the rain and the howls of nearly 40 mile-per-hour winds whipping against the building’s exterior. For the hundreds in attendance, the main show was not just in front of them, but all around. It was their first look inside the cherished UNESCO world heritage site following an estimated €700 million ($739 million) restoration. Centuries of grime has been wiped away to reveal an immaculate but aesthetically dissonant house of worship a Gothic church that glistens. “The world will find again this cathedral rebuilt and embellished,” Macron said. “Tonight, together, we can share joy and pride.” The French president, who is mired in a political crisis , attempted to use the global spotlight on his country to showcase French soft power while also stoking pride and patriotism at home, as he did during the Paris Olympics. “We rediscovered what great nations can do: accomplish the impossible,” Macron told the more than 2,000-strong congregation. “The cathedral became a beautiful metaphor for what a nation is, and what the world should be,” he added. And like the Summer Games’ opening ceremony, a wet and windy central Paris felt once again as if it was on lockdown. French authorities brought in an extra 6,000 security officers for the event and closed Ile de la Cite, the island in the Seine River where Notre Dame is located, to everyone except residents, law enforcement and attendees. Saturday’s ceremony kicked off with the tolling of Notre Dame’s bells, located in the cathedral’s tower where Victor Hugo’s hunchbacked bell ringer Quasimodo lived in 1831 novel. Dozens of bishops gathered outside, their white robes whipping in the wind as Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich struck the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff, to officially mark the cathedral’s reopening. Through the doorframe, onlookers saw floodlights beam onto the downpour, providing a cinematic backdrop for Notre Dame’s spiritual leader as he led his clergy in from the cold for the first time since the blaze on April 15, 2019, after what investigators believe was an accident. By the time some 600 firefighters had doused the fire’s final flames, much of Notre Dame, a jewel of Gothic architecture, lay in ruins. The 315-foot spire that had graced the Parisian skyline collapsed through the lead roof. “The forest,” an intricate, wooden lattice structure under the lead roof dating back to the 13th century, was completely destroyed. Centuries-old murals and priceless artifacts were covered in soot and lead. Macron had pledged to rebuild, asking that it be done in five years – an ambitious deadline that some experts panned as unrealistic. Yet after a herculean, 2,000-plus day effort involving more than 2,000 workers, “Our Lady of Paris” was ready to welcome visitors before the close of 2024. The world got its first glimpse inside , when cameras followed Macron on his seventh and final visit to the construction site. There he met with various artisans and expressed his gratitude to the 1,000-plus craftspeople in attendance who helped him keep his promise. Organizers used Saturday’s ceremony to honor many of the firefighters who responded to the blaze. Dozens were paraded through the nave as guests applauded. Later, the – France’s largest instrument complete with its 8,000 pipes and five keyboards – was played once more. Following the ceremony, Macron hosted a dinner at the Elysee palace for the 50 or so heads of state and government in attendance. While Saturday’s events marked Notre Dame’s official reopening, the inaugural mass will take place Sunday morning. Masses will be held twice daily for eight days, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these events will be open to the public but may require reservations in advance.

If the American analysis proves true, it would represent a spectacularly fast fall from power for the Syrian dictator after a , one that had been relatively stagnant until just last week. Officials cautioned that a formal assessment on Assad’s fate hasn’t emerged and that views vary, saying his demise isn’t a forgone conclusion. “The emerging consensus is that is an increasingly plausible scenario,” one senior US official said. “Probably by next weekend the Assad regime will have lost any semblance of power,” another official said. “Only thing that would delay a rebel conquest would be a well-organized coup and reorganization, but Assad’s folks have done a good job of stifling any potential competitors,” the official added. Another source familiar with US intelligence about the developments noted that so far, the opposition has made progress because regime forces have largely not stayed in the fight. But the areas the opposition forces have advanced the most — Aleppo, Idlib and Hama — also are not flush with regime support, so they encountered less resistance, this person said. “The question is whether regime forces actually stand their ground when it comes to Damascus,” they added. Rebels are racing toward the Syrian capital after routing government forces in in an advance that started just over a week ago. Homs, Syria’s third largest city, lies next in their path as they sweep south. Beyond there, the capital Damascus. The Biden administration appeared by the speed of the rebel advance launched last week. Regime troops have collapsed and melted away, leaving a fragile shell of an army to defend the president and Damascus. The US has misjudged the staying power of regimes before, most recently in Afghanistan — where the US intelligence community judged that the Afghan government would be more resilient than it ultimately was — and in Ukraine, which the US wrongly believed would fall to Russia within days of Moscow’s invasion. As a result, in 2022 the US intelligence launched a review of how it assesses the “will to fight” of foreign militaries, . White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Saturday that the US is “not going to dive into” the civil war in Syria but that it will “take steps” to prevent any potential resurgence of ISIS. “What we are going to do is focus on the American national security priorities and interests,” Sullivan said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. The offensive is the first major flare-up in years between the Syrian opposition and the regime of Assad, who has ruled the war-torn country since 2000. Syria’s civil war began during the 2011 Arab Spring as the regime suppressed a pro-democracy uprising against Assad. More than 300,000 civilians have been killed in more than a decade of war, according to the United Nations, and millions of people have been displaced. Leading the rebel advance in Syria is a group designated by the US as terrorist organization: Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which was previously linked to al Qaeda. “We have real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization,” Sullivan told CNN last weekend. “At the same time, of course, we don’t cry over the fact that the Assad government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, are facing certain kinds of pressure.” There is little sign that Iran and Russia — whose support have kept Assad in power — are going to swoop in to save him, at least in a way that would make a difference. Russia is bogged down with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has been significantly weakened after Israel’s recent strikes on its air defenses and decimation of its regional proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. HTS appears to have taken advantage of the fact that Assad’s allies were all distracted — and that the world was not paying much attention to Syria — when it launched its operation, one of the US officials said. One of the US officials said the Pentagon, which has around 900 troops in Syria, is not making plans to change its force posture in the country and is waiting to see what happens while taking additional force protection measures. The US has long partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces for anti-ISIS operations in Syria. The SDF has maintained contact with the rebel group known as HTS, the US official said, but the US does not communicate with HTS because it is considered a terrorist organization. HTS does not appear to have the overt support of Assad adversary Turkey, but US officials believe Turkey gave the group a green light to launch its operation. One significant concern the administration has is the safety of Assad’s stockpile of chemical weapons, thought to include both chlorine and sarin, in rebel areas to the horror of the international community. It is unclear where Assad would flee to, US officials said. His patrons could offer refuge in Moscow or Tehran, and it remains to be seen whether the rebels will set their sights on Latakia, an enclave of the Alawite sect to which Assad belongs. The potential fall of the regime in Syria comes at a critical time in the United States as President prepares to hand over power to President-elect . The incoming president is already making his views clear, taking to social media Saturday to call for the US to stay out of any potential regime change and let the conflict unfold. “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend,” he wrote, urging a hands-off approach and concluding with the message: “LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!” Early in his first term, against Assad’s regime in response to a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians. Trump to withdraw US troops involved in the fight against ISIS from northern Syria, though hundreds remained in the country. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, warned Friday on social media that the US government needs to ensure ISIS prisoners detained in northeast Syria are not set free and that US troops in the country have the support they need. “If there is a further collapse of the Syrian government, I fear that U.S. forces could be put in jeopardy. It is therefore imperative that we have contingency plans to reinforce our troops to make sure the anti-ISIS mission does not collapse,” the South Carolina Republican wrote on X.

As the teams headed for the locker room, Beck laid in pain on the Mercedes Benz Stadium turf, surrounded by Georgia medical staff. ABC’s cameras caught his mother in the stands, looking on in pain of her own as her son was helped to the locker room by team doctors. At that point, Texas led 6-3 in what was a defensive struggle. The Dawgs had already struggled to move the ball and now Beck was ruled out for the rest of the game. Georgia’s hopes for another SEC championship and a bye in the first round of the College Football Playoffs now hinged on Stockton, who had thrown a grand total of 16 passes all season entering Saturday’s game. The sophomore from Tiger, Georgia, was beyond ready. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said after the game that his team was fired up at halftime and the offense in particular was ready to rally behind the backup. “This team never, ever says no. Never die attitude, man,” Smart said. What had once been a lifeless Bulldogs offense sprung into life with Stockton under center, scoring a touchdown to take the lead on the first drive of the third quarter. Using both his arm and his legs, the redshirt sophomore brought the partisan Atlanta crowd to its feet and suddenly the Dawgs had all the momentum. After Georgia kicked a field goal to take a 16-13 lead with just four-and-a-half minutes remaining, it looked like it was going to be up to the nasty UGA defense to hold off Quinn Ewers and the high-powered Longhorn offense. And it appeared they had done it – Daylen Evertte’s interception with 3:36 to go in the game looked like it had sealed a conference championship for Georgia. But Stockton made his only misstep of the contest just a few plays later. On a 3rd-and-13 play from the Texas 31, the QB floated a ball that was ripe for an interception, and Texas’ Jahdae Barron picked the ball off and gave his team a chance. The Longhorns drove down the field and kicked a field goal to tie the game on the following drive, sending the game into overtime. It was in the extra session that Beck – who had been shown on the sidelines without his helmet, mingling among his teammates and looking for all the world like a man whose night was done – once again entered the fray. On 2nd-and-8 from the Texas 12-yard line, Stockton took off from the pocket and burst through the middle of the Longhorns defense for a first down. The quarterback appeared about to run through the arms of a Longhorn defender before Texas defensive back Andrew Mukuba closed in and delivered a devastating hit that sent Stockton’s helmet flying and dropped him to the turf, knees buckling as his body twisted and reeled from the impact. He stood up on his own power, though he appeared to stumble once getting to his feet. The referees determined the hit wasn’t targeting and Mukuba stayed in the game, but Stockton could not. Because he had lost his helmet, the quarterback was forced to come out of the game for at least a play. And suddenly, all eyes turned back to Beck. The senior quarterback was back in his helmet, practicing taking snaps under center on the sidelines. But when he ran onto the field, the extent of his situation became clear — his right arm, the one that he throws with, was hanging limply by his side and bouncing with each step, a clear sign that he would not be throwing the ball. He didn’t have to. Beck got under center and used that injured right arm to hand the ball off to running back Trevor Etienne, who burst through the line and went four yards to deliver the game-winning touchdown, handing the Dawgs a 22-19 victory. “Both of them, great competitors,” Smart said when asked about his quarterbacks. He also shouted out the big men up front who helped ensure that Beck didn’t need to run another play and Stockton didn’t need to re-enter the fray after the big hit: “How about that offensive line, to go on the five-yard line and run it in in the goal line, right into the teeth of a really, really good defense.” The Bulldogs have lost a grand total of three games in the last three years. A team doesn’t get to that point without players who play their best in winning time – even if they’re unable to use all of their limbs in the biggest moments of the game or have only played in two games all season before crunch time in a championship game. With fans and teammates celebrating around him, Stockton calmly told ESPN’s Holly Rowe how he stayed so poised in the spotlight. “It just goes back to this love I have for everybody in the locker room and for all the seniors. I just wanted them to go out on the right way,” he said. Smart, was clearly proud of Stockton while speaking to Rowe afterward. “This kid is a winner, man.

The pair – one of four surviving pairs Garland wore in the film – is the most valuable movie memorabilia ever sold at auction, according to a from Heritage Auctions. “There is simply no comparison between Judy Garland’s ruby slippers and any other piece of Hollywood memorabilia,” Heritage Auctions Executive Vice President Joe Maddalena said in the release. “The breathtaking result reflects just how important movies and movie memorabilia are to our culture and to collectors.” With auction house commissions, the slippers’ total price was a staggering $32.5 million, nearly 11 times what the auction house says was their pre-auction estimate of $3 million. “At $32.5 million, the slippers are the most valuable cinema treasures in the world, and they helped make this the most successful entertainment auction ever held,” according to Robert Wilonsky, vice president for public relations at Heritage Auctions. Other pairs have been to auction before, but none sold for nearly as much as the ones sold Saturday. In 2000, one pair of ruby slippers from the movie auctioned for $666,000, according to the release. Years later, Steven Spielberg and Leonardo DiCaprio bought a different pair for $2 million and donated them to the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, according to the release. On Saturday, bidding opened at $1.55 million and escalated quickly. According to the , 25 bidders participated. Only two bidders remained toward the end, and the slippers were sold to a bidder participating over the phone. The shoes are among the most beloved artifacts from the iconic 1939 movie. The slippers “were much more than just a piece of Hollywood memorabilia, much more than a valuable piece of industry history,” said Rhys Thomas, the author of “The Ruby Slippers of Oz.” “They transcended Hollywood, to the point where they represented the powerful image of innocence to all America,” he said, according to the lot page. The slippers auctioned Saturday had been lent by collector Michael Shaw to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, but were stolen from the museum in 2005. They were recovered in 2018 during a sting operation in Minneapolis, CNN . FBI agents this year , who “likened the experience to a heartfelt reunion with a long-lost friend.” Terry Martin and Jerry Hal Saliterman, both in their 70s, were separately charged with the theft. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023, while Saliterman, who was charged in 2024, maintains he’s innocent, previously reported. Only four pairs of the slippers used in the film are still known to exist, according to Heritage Auctions and the . One pair is housed at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, though they . Other items from the iconic movie were sold during Saturday’s auction, including a hat belonging to the Wicked Witch character (more than $2 million); the screen door ($37,500) from Dorothy’s Kansas home; the MGM contract signed by the “Over the Rainbow” songwriters ($23,125); and Judy Garland’s “Dorothy Gale” wig ($30,000) she used in the first week of shooting, the says. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The divers were seen in water known as the Lake, near the park’s iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain, the official said. At least two key pieces of evidence in the Wednesday killing of continued to evade investigators Saturday, including an electric bike the suspect rode and the gun used in the killing. On Friday evening, authorities found a backpack in the park which will be tested at a forensic lab in Queens, a law enforcement official told CNN. No gun was found in the backpack believed to have belonged to the gunman, law enforcement officials said Saturday. Authorities have yet to officially confirm the bag’s origins, an official told CNN Friday. The Peak Design backpack contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, according to the officials. It was not immediately clear if other items were in the backpack, officials said. Federal investigators are assisting the NYPD as they piece together clues, including the backpack, photos, video, ammunition, DNA and more, to help zero in on a suspect they believe is no longer in the city. The it is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the gunman. “We are seeking the public’s help in identifying the unknown suspect responsible for the homicide,” the FBI said Friday in an agency news release. The NYPD is also offering a reward of up to $10,000, the department said in a Thursday. The shooting suspect, believed to have left New York City on an interstate bus, has not been identified or located following the shooting police believe was “definitely planned,” NYPD officials told CNN on Friday. The suspect traveled to New York City last month on a that began its route in Atlanta, officials have said. On Saturday, detectives from the NYPD arrived in Atlanta to help further the investigation, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. T has said it is assisting New York police. New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Saturday cited the backpack’s discovery as “obviously a positive development.” “Let him continue to believe he can hide behind a mask,” Adams said of the suspect. “We’re going to reveal who he is, and we’re going to bring him to justice.” Investigators are focused on identifying the unmasked man pictured in surveillance images released Thursday which authorities say offers a significant clue in the search. Investigators appear to be homing in on the possible identity of the suspect, two people briefed on the investigation said, but are still working to verify the information and are not yet certain they know his identity. New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told CNN on Friday authorities have gathered “a ,” including fingerprints, DNA evidence and a “massive camera canvass” of the suspect’s movements throughout the city. Investigators are examining whether the shooter used a specialized weapon in the killing, Joseph Kenny, the chief detective of the NYPD, told reporters Friday. “This isn’t ‘Blue Bloods.’ We’re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We’re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across,” Kenny said. Law enforcement officials have briefed border guards on both sides of the US border with Canada and Mexico to be on the lookout for the suspect, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNN. Upon his arrival in New York on November 24, the suspect took a cab from the Port Authority bus terminal to the vicinity of the Hilton Hotel and stayed there for about half an hour, he said. Investigators say the suspect then used a fake New Jersey driver’s license to check into an Upper West Side hostel which has since notified its guests it is cooperating with the police investigation. Photos from the hostel along with believed to have been dropped by the suspect upon fleeing the Wednesday shooting scene outside the Hilton Midtown have offered investigators additional clues in the case. Kenny told reporters the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets. The bullets are still being tested, he said. Police are exploring whether the words could , since they are similar to a phrase commonly used to describe insurance company tactics: “Delay, deny, defend.” The phrase is also the title of a book . “It could possibly be a disgruntled employee or a disgruntled client,” Kenny said Friday when asked about the words on the bullets. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare, has mapped out security plans for employees in the wake of the attack. “We’re ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of our employees,” said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group in an email sent to employees on Thursday and obtained by CNN. NYPD investigators appear to be getting closer to a possible identification of the suspected shooter, two people briefed on the investigation said late Friday. Investigators are working to track the suspect’s potential whereabouts with the help of thousands of investigative leads, including traces of DNA which could help find the killer, the people briefed on the probe said. Investigators are still working to verify the information as of Saturday. Some techniques have led to dead ends, with detectives unable to use facial recognition on the unmasked hostel photos to identify the shooter – possibly because of the angle of images or restrictions of the database, Kenny told reporters Friday. A fingerprint previously obtained by police was unusable for an identification, he said, adding it could be enhanced later in the investigation. Bus manifests likewise may not be helpful since identification is not required to board, according to Kenny. Police have been able to use surveillance video to track the shooter’s movements after he arrived in New York City on November 24 and for a short time directly after the December 4 shooting. Investigators are processing video from the Port Authority in hopes of finding out what bus he got on if he did board one. They have also contacted UnitedHealthcare’s security team to obtain its own person-of-interest list, looking for people who have been publicly vocal with complaints against the company, according to the source. There’s no indication, however, that the shooter and CEO had any prior interactions or that the shooting was related to Thompson’s personal life, Kenny said in the Friday news briefing. Police are asking about anyone who has used any vitriolic language and made threats, either on social media or through attendance at public demonstrations. “As we’re going through our investigation, we’re coming across a lot of online comments, a lot of online threats, things of that nature. His wife indicated that he had received some prior threats,” Kenny said. The law enforcement source said most people on the list have been already been dismissed by using social media searches. The rest are being looked into for any possible ties. The mandate is to continue to build a video timeline of every day the suspect was in the city, the source said. Identifying the suspect is critical and multiple law enforcement agencies are offering to help in the search once an identification is made, the source added. How the suspect carried out the deadly shooting may suggest he practiced the attack ahead of time, former FBI Special Agent Ken Gray told CNN on Saturday. “The fact that he was able to get to that location, be there in time, shoot Thompson and then get to his bike and get out of there and be on a bus out of the area, out of New York City as quickly as he did, that shows that he practiced this, that he knew what he was doing as far as his exit route from the area,” Gray said. The suspected shooter still made errors that could help authorities track him down, according to Gray. “He made the mistake of going into the Starbucks and leaving his forensic evidence behind there with the DNA, with the fingerprints,” Gray said. “Is this guy a professional assassin? I don’t think so. But is this a person who really thought this through? I think that’s definitely the case,” he said. Investigators are treating the backpack found in Central Park like a dead body, being very careful not to damage any potential evidence, a law enforcement official told CNN. The backpack was removed by an excavator along with any physical material found surrounding it, the official said. No officers picked it up, because there may be some DNA evidence tied to the backpack or even the dirt on the ground surrounding it. “Their instructions were, ‘If you find it, freeze the location, do not touch it. Wait for the detectives, wait for the crime scene unit and let them package this up,’” CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller told Anderson Cooper on Friday. “This is one of these things where even touching it or going through it with rubber gloves, you can smudge prints, move DNA, contaminate it with your own material,” Miller said. “When they go to trial, they want to be able to testify this was all done with perfect procedure in terms of trying to preserve that evidence and then extract that evidence,” he added. Forensic investigators at a police lab in Queens will go through the contents of the bag slowly and deliberately, examining not only the contents but the bag itself, which may contain sweat or other evidence connected to the shooter, the official said. Investigators are also looking into the possibility the gunman who killed Thompson may have used what is , a larger firearm used on farms and ranches to put down animals without causing a loud noise, Kenny, the chief detective of the NYPD, said Friday. The veterinary gun is based on the design of a British-made Welrod pistol, dating back to World War II, was an assassin’s weapon, Miller explained. “It’s practically silent. It’s a significant round. It’s a 9 millimeter round. And it’s meant for close-up killing. It’s meant for vets to kill an animal by shooting it in the head or somewhere, you know, that’s going to be fatal. But it would work the exact same way on humans, very effectively and extraordinarily quietly,” Miller said. CNN’s Ashley R.

Meanwhile, some of Trump’s Cabinet picks could face uphill confirmation battles. Trump his defense secretary pick, , and expressed confidence in his chances of being confirmed despite . Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa on Saturday again called for a thorough vetting of Pete Hegseth — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon — as he faces amid a related to his workplace behavior and treatment of women. “I do think it’s incredibly important that we offer him the opportunity for a fair and thorough process,” Ernst, whose vote could be among the most crucial to Hegseth’s chances, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. “I take my duties in vetting all nominees very seriously.” Ernst’s comments come after Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host, to shore up support with key senators who will vote on his confirmation. Ernst was one of several Republicans who declined to endorse him, instead calling for further vetting. Amid calls for more vetting, Hegseth’s name was for a background check, his attorney told CNN on Thursday. Following Trump’s selection of Hegseth, a 2017 against him surfaced. as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, CNN previously reported. Hegseth has denied the allegation, claiming the encounter was consensual, and no charges were filed. Ernst is a veteran who’s taken on sexual assault in the military and has about being a survivor of sexual assault. CNN previously reported that the Iowa senator’s name was floated as a potential replacement for Hegseth. Ernst said Saturday that she is looking forward to meeting with Hegseth next week and stressed that he will face “a very thorough vetting” before his nomination could move forward. “I’m excited to have the opportunity to sit down with him again, but there will be a very thorough vetting before he moves forward,” Ernst said, adding that he will “have to answer some very tough questions.” The Iowa senator said she would like to hear more from Hegseth about “the role of women” in the US military and how to get “the Pentagon through a clean audit.” Hegseth to allow women into combat roles. Outgoing Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell subtly criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s foreign policy views during a Saturday speech at the Reagan National Defense Forum. Drawing on former President Ronald Reagan’s firm Cold War stance, McConnell warned in his remarks in Simi Valley, California, that some influential voices are ignoring key lessons from that era as global threats continue to escalate. “But let’s be absolutely clear: America will not be made great again by those who are content to manage our decline,” the Kentucky Republican said, alluding to Trump’s campaign slogan. Trump has repeatedly criticized global alliances such as NATO and expressed reluctance on US involvement in foreign conflicts, including in its fight against Russia. McConnell is a staunch supporter of US aid to Kyiv and said amid attacks from the Trump wing of the GOP that “every argument” against Ukraine aid is “wrong.” Though McConnell is stepping down from his party leadership position in January, he will chair the all-important Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The Kentucky Republican has emphasized that he wants to focus the rest of his time in office on beating back the isolationist strain in his party. McConnell was honored Saturday with the “Peace Through Strength” award alongside outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. McConnell stressed that renewing America’s leadership on the world stage requires a steadfast commitment to “peace through strength.” Austin used his remarks to announce a for Ukraine as he forcefully argued for US leadership around the world. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Saturday stressed the need for a “seamless” transition with President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security team, saying officials are in contact with their successors. “It has been professional, it has been substantive, and frankly, it has been good,” Sullivan said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. “Obviously, we don’t see eye to eye on every issue, and that’s no secret to anybody, but there is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with, including my successor, and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition.” Sullivan noted that while the need for a smooth transition is always true, it is particularly important now given the multitude of conflicts around the globe, from the war in Gaza to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On top of maintaining the House, Republicans will take control of the Senate and the White House in January, handing them complete control of Washington for the first time since early 2019. While the incoming Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill have big ideas about how to spend their political capital, they will be limited by slim majorities in the House and Senate. For a better idea of what to expect, I talked to CNN congressional correspondent . Our conversation, edited for style and length, is below: If they stick with the current order that they’re talking about — which is by the way, not a sure thing — but let’s say that they try to tackle immigration first, the budget process in the Senate that allows you to pass a bill with 51 votes, known as reconciliation, has a lot of limited parameters around what you can actually do. So Republicans can’t do wide, sweeping immigration policy changes through that first bill. But what they could do is invest a lot of money in border security. They could basically plus up how much they’re spending on those priorities, and they could move some money around. That could still be really significant for the Trump administration, because Trump talked about the border so much and because Republicans campaigned on that issue. President-elect Donald Trump met with Prince William on Saturday evening at the UK ambassador’s residence in Paris following the Notre Dame reopening ceremony. “He’s doing a fantastic job,” Trump said of Prince William, calling the British heir to the throne a “good man.” Trump was scheduled to meet Prince William earlier Saturday, but the meeting was delayed due to poor weather. President-elect Donald Trump has left Notre Dame following the cathedral’s reopening ceremony, along with other high-profile guests, including tech billionaire Elon Musk, first lady Jill Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Fifty heads of state and government have been invited to attend a dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace. Trump is expected to attend and mingle with other foreign leaders, including a “private pull aside” with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The reopening ceremony lasted around two hours. It was led by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich and featured a choir performance, the sounding of Notre Dame’s grand organ — France’s largest instrument — and remarks from Macron. Thanking those involved in the restoration of Notre Dame after the devastating 2019 fire, Macron said: “The cathedral became a beautiful metaphor for what a nation is, and what the world should be.” President-elect Donald Trump is expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister after the Notre Dame reopening ceremony Saturday, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. The two will meet at a reception held by French President Emmanuel Macron, the source added, describing the meeting as a “private pull aside.” Meloni was as the prime minister of Italy, leading the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini. She entered Italy’s crowded political scene in 2006 and co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012, a party whose agenda is rooted in Euroskepticism and anti-immigration policies. Trump is also expected to mingle with several other foreign leaders at the dinner reception. Trump’s meeting with Britian’s Prince William, which was scheduled for Saturday afternoon but delayed due to poor weather, is now expected to take place later in the day. Following the dinner reception, Trump is expected to fly back to Florida. Tech billionaire Elon Musk has arrived at Notre Dame Cathedral to attend the reopening ceremony. He’s one of the VIP guests invited alongside some religious officials and world leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump. Musk has emerged as a key player in Trump’s orbit and has been tapped by the president-elect to co-lead the newly formed . Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to get Trump elected, . President-elect Donald Trump has entered Notre Dame for the Parisian cathedral’s reopening. Trump walked down the right side of the nave through thousands of attendees, including heads of state, major business leaders and Catholic dignitaries. The president-elect was greeted to a small round of applause as he approached the front of the cathedral, where he was assigned a seat between French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte. Set to be seated on the other side of the French first lady was her American counterpart, Jill Biden. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky greeted to a standing ovation as he approached his seat. Also in attendance at the ceremony: The event will begin with a speech from Macron. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a “good and productive trilateral meeting” with US President-elect Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace on Saturday. “We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” Zelensky said in a post on X, adding that the three countries have agreed to continue working together. Zelensky also said of the president-elect: “President Trump is, as always, resolute.” Trump and Zelensky were originally set to hold separate consecutive talks with Macron. Zelensky that he wants to work “directly” with Trump and that he is open to his ideas, highlighting Kyiv’s eagerness to keep its most important ally onside as Russia intensifies its attacks. The United States is the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine in the country’s fight against Russia. Trump on continued US aid to Kyiv and has repeatedly claimed the war would not have started if he had been president. In July, he said he could settle the war in one day, without saying how he would do so. President-elect Donald Trump has arrived at Notre Dame for the famed cathedral’s reopening ceremony. He came from the Élysée Palace, with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. President-elect Donald Trump will now meet Britain’s Prince William after the Notre Dame reopening ceremony, according to Kensington Palace. Prince William will also now only meet with first lady Jill Biden at the ceremony, Kensington Palace said, citing delays due to weather. President-elect Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening ceremony lasted just over half an hour at the Élysée Palace. Trump and Zelensky were originally set to hold separate consecutive talks with Macron. The United States is the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine in the country’s fight against Russia. Trump has cast doubts on continued US aid to Kyiv and has repeatedly claimed the war would not have started if he had been president. In July, he said he could settle the war in one day, without saying how he would do so. Zelensky said at the end of November he wanted and was open to his ideas. He also said Russia’s war with his country could end next year and that he was awaiting Trump’s proposals on resolving the conflict. The two met at Trump’s New York base in Trump Tower in September. Zelensky characterized his conversations with Trump during that visit as “warm, good, constructive.” French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed US President-elect Donald Trump to the Elysee Palace on Saturday with the pair’s now-customary grappling handshakes, as Trump visited for a meeting ahead of the reopening ceremony for the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Speaking to reporters before they met privately, Macron and Trump both expressed optimism about the future of their relationship and fondly recalled Trump’s first time in office — a broadly friendly but occasionally turbulent period in US-France relations. “We had a great relationship, as everyone knows. We’ve accomplished a lot together. And the people of France are spectacular. I guess it’s one of our largest groups in the United States, French people,” Trump said. “And we respect them and we love them. Very talented people, extremely energetic people, as you know very well.” Macron, whose government is , grinned throughout Trump’s remarks and audibly agreed with Trump’s assessment. “We had a good time together and we had a lot of, a lot of success, really great success working together on defense and offense, too,” Trump continued. “And it certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now.” As the men met in Paris, with an estimated 50 fellow world leaders either in town or en route, appeared to be nearing collapse, with rebel forces threatening to encircle the capital city of Damascus. Macron called Trump’s visit “a great honor for French people,” then recalled Trump’s response to the Notre Dame fire five years earlier. “You were at that time president, for the first time, and I remember the solidarity and your immediate action,” Macron said. “So welcome back again. We’re very happy to have you here.” US President-elect Donald Trump has arrived at the Elysée Palace to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump arrived in Paris early on Saturday to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, his first trip overseas since he won the US presidential election in November. Macron was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump after he became just the second US president to win a nonconsecutive term. Macron is also meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the afternoon, and Trump is meeting with Britain’s Prince William ahead of the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening ceremony. President-elect Donald Trump weighed in Saturday on the in Syria, where opposition forces have reportedly seized control of several cities and are advancing on Damascus. : “THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!” Trump also argued that if Syrian rebels are able to force out President Bashar al-Assad, “it may actually be the best thing that can happen” to Russia, which he argued is too preoccupied with the war with Ukraine to stop the rebel fighters. The president-elect also blamed the Obama administration for failing to enforce the 2013 “red line” that stated that Syria’s use of chemical weapons would mean US military action. Reiterating his “America First” stance, Trump argued that Syria is not the US’ fight. “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend,” he wrote, urging a hands-off approach. While in office, Trump of a military strike in 2017 on a Syrian government airbase in response to a that killed dozens of civilians. He ordered 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the airbase that was home to the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks in what was the first direct military action taken by the US against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s . His decision at the time marked a dramatic shift in his position on whether the US should take military action against the Syrian president’s regime — which Trump opposed during his first campaign for president. President-Elect Donald Trump unveiled a new line of fragrances under the brand name “Trump Perfumes & Colognes” in a post Saturday on Truth Social. The collection, named “Fight, Fight, Fight,” is designed to embody the spirit of victory and is also what Trump yelled after being shot this summer. “I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING,” Trump . The new fragrance line is being marketed as the ideal holiday gift and is available for purchase at gettrumpfragrances.com. The collection includes cologne for men and perfume for women, each priced at $199. Notably, the “Victory” line has already sold out on the website. “Here are my new Trump Perfumes & Colognes! I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family. Go to . Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!” Prince William will meet with US President-elect Donald Trump in Paris on Saturday, Kensington Palace has announced. The pair will meet while they are both in the French capital for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was heavily damaged after being engulfed in flames in 2019. More than five years later, after intensive restoration, the Parisian landmark is officially being reopened on Saturday. William will be attending the reopening ceremony on behalf of the United Kingdom, the palace said. He will also meet with US first lady Jill Biden, who he last saw at the coronation of his father King Charles III in London last year. The prince last met with Trump during his state visit to the UK in 2019. This will be Trump’s first overseas trip since his election in November to a second term in office. President-elect is to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, his first overseas trip since his election victory in November. Trump’s team had been in discussions for days with French President Emmanuel Macron’s office regarding the visit, and the US president-elect was invited by the French government to attend the reopening, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. “President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Monday. “It will be a very special day for all!” Trump and Macron worked together closely throughout the first Trump administration, with their relationship being described as somewhat of a “bromance,” though at times they appeared hostile toward one another. Macron was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump after he became only the second US president ever to win a nonconsecutive term, writing on X: “Congratulations, President . Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.” Later that evening, Trump and Macron spoke by phone, Macron’s office said. As soon as the invitation was received, Trump told his team he wanted to attend as he has long held a fascination with Notre Dame, which was severely damaged by a fire in 2019. At the time, Trump watched footage of the fire while aboard Air Force One, commenting on social media: “So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!” President-elect Donald Trump on Friday , even as he acknowledged “people were a little bit concerned” about his pick to lead the Pentagon amid a series of allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct. “Looks like Pete is doing well now. I mean, people were a little bit concerned,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker in an interview at Trump Tower. “He’s a young guy with a tremendous track record. Actually, went to Princeton and went to Harvard. He was a good student at both, but he loves the military, and I think people are starting to see it. So, we’ll be working on his nomination, along with a lot of others.” Asked whether he has confidence in Hegseth’s chances of being confirmed, Trump said, “Yes, I do, I really do.” But while Trump said he’s spoken with senators about Hegseth — whom, he said, they have called “fantastic” — the president-elect said he has not gotten any assurances from senators that he’ll earn confirmation. The comments from the president-elect marked the latest public praise for his embattled choice for secretary of defense after days of support behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, Trump said that Hegseth “is doing very well” in a post on social media. “His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe,” Trump on his Truth Social platform. “He was a great student - Princeton/Harvard educated - with a Military state of mind. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!” , the treasured Gothic gem in Paris that went up in flames in 2019, will officially reopen Saturday. Immediately after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious pledge to restore the church within five years. Here’s everything you need to know about the days ahead. On April 15, 2019, Notre Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the blaze remains a mystery. Investigators say it was likely an accident — perhaps a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction. France — and much of the world — despaired as the 860-year-old cathedral’s roof caved in, strewing the stone floor below with soot. Macron called it a “terrible tragedy,” and pledged to rebuild the landmark church “because it is what our history deserves.” Some of the country’s richest businessmen pledged hundreds of millions of euros toward the restoration. The guest list will be long and illustrious, but the most notable attendee will be Donald Trump. The US president-elect he will travel to Paris — his first overseas trip since last month’s election — for what will be “a very special day for all.” The ceremony is expected to draw some 50 heads of state and government. One noteworthy absentee, however, will be Pope Francis. The pontiff will travel to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on December 15, just days after the reopening, but is skipping a visit to the capital. A leading French archbishop said the “star” of the ceremony ought to be Notre Dame itself, and that the pope did not want to distract from the occasion. Some 170 bishops from France and around the world will also be involved in the ceremony, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral at around 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). The Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich will then strike the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff. Once the doors open, the cathedral “responds” to the knock by singing Psalm 121 — which begins “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills” — three times. After this, the doors will open. The ceremony then proceeds in three parts. First, the “awakening” of the great organ — the largest in France, comprising 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Second, the “chanting of the office” — a series of psalms and prayers, including the Lord’s Prayer. Then, the archbishop will give a final blessing and the choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn. The service will be followed by a broadcast by France TV chronicling the cathedral’s rebuilding. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia ( ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( ). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of , announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron ( ), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Now, a photo of an orca has observers wondering if the trend has returned.", "language": "en", "datePublished": "2024-12-07T12:00:42.721Z", "dateModified": "2024-12-08T06:04:40.172000+00:00", "content": ". Fashion is fickle and styles come and go — even for orcas, apparently. In 1987, a group of killer whales off the northwestern coast of North America briefly donned salmon “hats,” carrying dead fish on their heads for weeks. Recently, a male orca known as J27, or “Blackberry,” was photographed in Washington’s Puget Sound wearing a salmon on his head, and many observers declared that the trend had returned. But while the sight of the salmon-wearing orca sparked excitement, “there have been no further recent images of these orcas wearing salmon hats,” said Stephanie Raymond, a program manager of the Orca Network, a nonprofit that promotes awareness and conservation of orcas and other marine mammals of the Pacific Northwest. These killer whales visit Puget Sound annually, and when they do, “there is no shortage of eyes on the water and cameras capturing their visit, in addition to permitted research vessels carefully observing them,” Raymond told CNN in an email. If the so-called trend of wearing salmon hats was making a comeback among these orcas, “there would be ample documentation of that,” she said. Photographer Jim Pasola captured the image of J27 and his fish headgear on October 25 from Point No Point, a site on the tip of a peninsula in the Puget Sound. On October 29, the Orca Network shared the photo in its Whale Sighting Report email. A subcommunity of the orcas, known as J Pod, were hunting salmon in Puget Sound, and J27 swam at the surface with a salmon draped over the top of his head. “I saw it in our email summary of the reports of that week,” said , a former orca researcher and Orca Network’s cofounder and board president. “It was a highlighted photograph, a lucky shot.” About 10 days later, another salmon-wearing orca briefly surfaced near scientists who were gathering data in Puget Sound, said , one of the researchers on the boat and the science and research director for the conservation group Wild Orca. “We utilize a scent detection dog on the front of our boat to help us sniff out floating killer whale poop,” Giles said. The researchers were tracking a group of whales, and everyone’s attention — including the dog’s — was focused ahead of them. “I was driving the boat,” Giles said. “I happened to look back over my shoulder, and there was a whale with their head out of the water, with a limp fish draped across their head.” Giles was unable to tell if the orca was J27; identifying features such as the dorsal fin and saddle patch on its back were underwater. “But the fish was definitely up there,” she said. “I had enough time to holler to the front of the boat, ‘Hey, there’s fish-on-head behind me!’” But before her colleagues could respond, the unidentified orca and its fish hat had slipped below the surface. For Garrett, the photo of J27 wearing a fish was “a throwback to 1987, when several of the Southern Resident orcas threw fish on their heads and swam around, as if they were proud of them,” he said. are a single population of killer whales made up of three close-knit family groups, or pods: J pod, K pod and L pod. Unlike most killer whales that swim the world’s oceans, Southern Resident orcas stick together, gathering annually in Puget Sound to feast on salmon during the summer and fall. Other killer whales feed on fish, octopus and marine mammals, but the diet of Southern Resident whales is almost entirely salmon. They are an endangered population, with just 72 orcas in all three pods, Garrett said. In 1987, a female in the K pod began carrying a fish on her head. Other orcas soon began doing the same, recalled Giles, who witnessed the odd behavior. “I actually saw the whales physically myself for the first time in 1987,” Giles said. “These whales were on the west side of San Juan (Island), foraging on fish every day. We saw a fair amount of salmon hats at that time.” The behavior spread to the other Southern Resident pods over the next five to six weeks, then petered out. “It was noted a few times the following summer, and then never again,” researchers reported in December 2004 in the journal . Another orca wearing a salmon hat was photographed during a 2019 survey by the marine conservation group Ocean Wise. In a February 2022 Instagram post, researchers wrote that the orca was A99 “Alder,” a young male with the Northern Resident clan. Drone footage (obtained with a special research permit) showed A99’s mother repeatedly offering the fish to her offspring. A99 took a single bite, but the youngster seemed more interested in balancing the salmon on his face. Even if J27’s fish-wearing doesn’t signal a return of salmon hats among the Southern Resident orcas, what does the behavior mean? One explanation could be simple playfulness, Garrett said. For most of October, the Southern Resident clan gorged on salmon in Puget Sound, and it’s possible that there was simply so much food that the orca couldn’t resist having some fun with his dinner. “For that extended period, they had a lot to eat. It was a kind of a celebration,” Garrett said. “It probably was in 1987, too. They were just enjoying the abundance of salmon and playing with their food.” But salmon-wearing could also have a practical purpose. It could be that the orcas kept the fish on their heads so they could eat them later or share them with a podmate, Giles said. “These animals cooperatively hunt and share food. They’ll literally bite a salmon in half or in thirds and share it with family members,” she said. Orcas are highly social animals, and killer whales in the Southern Resident clan are known for behaviors that reinforce social connections, such as elaborate greeting ceremonies. When salmon is plentiful, temporarily wearing a dead one as a hat could be another aspect of sharing food as a bonding experience in the group, Giles said. In fact, strong social connections between Southern Resident orcas might explain why salmon-wearing became so popular in 1987, Garrett added. “When one of them throws a fish on its head, that’s a social event,” he said. “I’m not surprised it did spread to other pods.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Big 12, (SEC), Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and championship game results provided near clarity on the 12-team CFP field to be announced on Sunday. Coming into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game between No. 8 Southern Methodist University (SMU) and No. 17 Clemson, there was potential for chaos to ensue, and that is exactly what happened on Saturday night at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Tigers walked-off the Mustangs 34-31 on a 56-yard field goal as the clock expired to give Clemson its eighth ACC title in 10 years. Before freshman placekicker Nolan Hauser cemented his name in Clemson lore, it was truly a tale of two halves. First quarter was all Clemson - with quarterback Cade Klubnik throwing three touchdowns on the Mustang defense to jump out to a quick 21-7 lead. However, the SMU offense slowly gained traction as the game went on despite losing 24-7 at halftime. Mustangs quarterback Kevin Jennings threw three second half touchdowns to chip away at the lead, with the last score coming with a mere 16 seconds left in the game to knot the contest up at 31-31. It appeared the game was headed to overtime. That is when Clemson wide receiver Adam Randall returned the ensuing kickoff 41 yards. Then, Klubnik found wide receiver Antonio Williams for 17 yards and quickly called a timeout to set up the 56-yard field goal for Hauser. As the kick went through the uprights, ESPN’s play caller Sean McDonough yelled out, “GOOD! At the buzzer. Clemson wins the ACC!” The kick was the first walk-off in ACC title game history and the longest field goal. With Clemson pulling off the upset, the Tigers get an automatic College Football Playoff entry as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Klubnik, a junior, finished with 262 yards and four touchdowns - tying former Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence for the most thrown in the conference championship game ever. He was also named the MVP of the title game. That leaves a two-loss SMU’s fate in the hands of the CFP selection committee, with many experts predicting a Mustangs’ stumble in the playoff bracket. After the game, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney was complimentary of both teams, including calling SMU a “playoff team.” “They better be in the dang playoffs. What a comeback by those guys,” Swinney told the ABC broadcast. “But listen, I am proud of our guys. We fought all night. … We found a way.” By a score of 22-19, No. 5 Georgia prevailed over No. 2 Texas for the second time this season in a game that featured all the drama of a Hollywood movie. Both teams brought defensive intensity, a hallmark of the conference that has produced 13 of the past 18 national champions. Neither team could find the endzone in the first half, with Texas taking a 6-3 lead to the intermission. A half marked by stout defense ended fittingly with a sack of Bulldogs’ quarterback Carson Beck that forced a fumble. Beck was slow to get up as he was attended to by UGA medical personnel with an apparent arm injury. With Beck unable to continue after halftime, sophomore Gunner Stockton entered as the Dawgs’ signal caller in his first appearance against an SEC opponent. Stockton, a backup who played in only three games all season and attempted just 16 passes, was a highly-touted recruit out of Rabun County, Georgia, in 2022. Stockton sparked the offense to a touchdown drive to open the second half and put Georgia in front. Bulldogs running back Trevor Etienne, returning after missing three games due to injury, ran in the 10-yard touchdown to give Georgia a 10-6 lead. The Longhorns would finally find the endzone early in the fourth quarter with a 41-yard strike from Quinn Ewers to DeAndre Moore Jr. to tie the game at 13. Georgia reclaimed the lead with a Peyton Woodring field goal, but a costly Stockton interception gave Texas the ball back with 2:25 remaining in the game. Texas drove the ball into field goal range to give kicker Bert Auburn a chance at redemption after missing two attempts earlier in the game. Auburn split the uprights from 37 yards out to tie the game at 16 and force overtime. Another field goal from Auburn put Texas ahead in the extra session, but that’s when the real drama began. Stockton set Georgia up with a first and goal after a gutsy run up the middle, but the quarterback got leveled by Texas safety Andrew Mukuba. The colossal hit caused Stockton’s helmet to pop off. The collision stopped the game to assess Stockton and determine whether there was targeting on the play. No penalty was called. Stockton was forced to come out of the game for one play by NCAA rule. Cue Carson Beck’s return. After spending the entire second half with his throwing elbow wrapped in ice, Beck trotted back onto the field with his right arm hanging limply by his side. Beck was able to take the snap and hand the ball off to Etienne, who pounded it in from four yards out for the game-winning touchdown. Kings of the 👑 With fans and teammates celebrating around him, Stockton calmly told ESPN’s Holly Rowe, how he stayed so poised in the spotlight. “It just goes back to this love I have for everybody in the locker room and for all the seniors. I just wanted them to go out on the right way,” he said. Georgia’s coach, Kirby Smart, was clearly proud of Stockton while speaking to Rowe afterward. “This kid is a winner, man. This kid is special.” Despite the disappointing loss, Texas is still expected to get into the CFP as the SEC’s runner-up. The nation’s top-ranked college football team looks the part. Oregon’s first season in the Big Ten proved wildly successful when it capped off a perfect campaign with a 45-37 win over Penn State on Friday. Behind an offensive explosion, the undefeated Oregon Ducks captured the Big Ten title and a program-best 13-0 record. Oregon’s Dillion Gabriel looked Heisman-worthy while racking up gaudy offensive numbers. The Ducks quarterback ripped through Penn State with 283 yards passing and four touchdowns. However, the No. 1 team in the land needed a defensive stop to halt a potential Penn State shocker when Nikko Reed intercepted Nittany Lions quarterback Drew Allar to secure the victory. The start of the game could hardly have been any more entertaining. Both teams scored a staggering seven touchdowns, combining for 55 points – the most in a half in Big Ten title game history. Gabriel knifed through the Nittany Lions’ defensive eleven from the jump, opening the scoring with a highlight reel touchdown in Indianapolis. The senior found wide receiver Kenyon Sadiq, who ‘wowed’ fans at Lucas Oil Stadium by hurdling over a defender en route to a 28-yard touchdown. The Ducks were up as many as 18 points in the second quarter with the Penn State faithful looking miserable as the Ducks ran rampant over the typically strong Nittany Lions defense. But Penn State staged a gutsy comeback. Allar led Penn State to two consecutive scores - throwing to Omari Evans for a TD and another via a QB-keeper. It was 31-24 at the half. Gabriel and Co. didn’t let up after the break. The lefty QB found a streaking Tez Johnson for a lightning-fast 48-yard TD reception to push the lead to two scores. Again, Penn State didn’t fade. The Nittany Lions junior running back, Kaytron Allen, scored on a 1-yard run to make it 38-30, only for Oregon to score again. Johnson ended the game with 11 receptions for 181 yards and a score while earning the game’s MVP award. In a ‘win and you’re in’ showdown, No. 15 Arizona State put a hurting on No. 16 Iowa State in the Big 12 title game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, winning by a score of 45-19. Arizona State put the rest of the CFP hopefuls on notice with a dynamic offensive display as the Sun Devils piled up the points against the Cyclones. ASU’s powerful running back, Cam Skattebo, averaged over 10 yards per carry, rushing for 170 yards and two touchdowns. Skattebo also hauled in a 33-yard touchdown pass. The Sun Devils’ aerial attack was equally impressive. ASU quarterback Sam Leavitt tossed three touchdown passes, including two to senior wide receiver Xavier Guillory, whose highlight reel catch in the third quarter, stretched the Devils’ lead to 28 points. Arizona State is led by Kenny Dillingham, who started the season as the youngest head coach in college football at age 34. Dillingham showed he’s willing to take a risky gamble, as he twice rolled the dice on fourth down, converting each time in drives that ended in touchdowns. Arizona State’s defense also made a statement in the second half, forcing Iowa State turnovers on three consecutive possessions as the Sun Devils pulled away. There was a scary moment on the first play of the fourth quarter, when ASU defensive back Shamari Simmons got an unchecked run at Cyclones quarterback Rocco Becht for a crushing sack. Simmons was ejected from the game for targeting while Becht left the field to receive medical attention. Becht would later be cleared to return to play. The Sun Devils, picked to finish dead last in the Big 12 in preseason polling, got the big day started with a statement win and claimed their first conference crown since 2007, when ASU was in the Pac-10 Conference.

An active search is underway for Bashar al-Assad with rebels questioning Syrian military officers and intelligence officials who might have knowledge about his movements, according to a source familiar with the rebels’ operations. Rebel forces declared Damascus “free” on Sunday, claiming Assad had fled the capital. The Syrian leader has not been seen or heard from publicly since rebels entered the capital early on Sunday morning. One US official told CNN that events in Syria mark the collapse of “Iran’s artifice” across the Middle East. The potential toppling of the Iran-backed Assad would follow the decimation of key Tehran proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in conflicts with Israel over the past 14 months. US President Joe Biden is “closely monitoring” developments in Syria, according to a statement. “President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,” National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett wrote on X. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said the government stands ready “to cooperate with any leadership the people choose,” in a recorded message on Sunday morning. “We are ready to cooperate with any leadership the people choose, offering all possible support to ensure a smooth and systematic transition of government functions, preserving state facilities,” he said. Ghazi al-Jalali called on Syrians to protect public facilities, saying they belonged to all citizens. “I am here in my home, did not leave and do not intend to leave it except in a peaceful manner to ensure the continuing operation of public institutions, state facilities, and to broadcast safety and security for all citizens.” “We extend our hands to every Syrian citizen who is concerned about safeguarding this nation’s assets… I urge all citizens not to harm any public property because, ultimately, it belongs to them.” The militant leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the main group driving the country’s armed opposition, released a statement calling on rebel forces to leave state institutions unharmed. “To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former Prime Minister until they are officially handed over, and it is also forbidden to fire bullets into the air,” Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, wrote on telegram. On Thursday, Jolani projected a different vision for the war-torn country in an interview with CNN. In a sign of his attempted rebranding, he also publicly used his real name for the first time – Ahmed al-Sharaa – instead of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the nom de guerre by which he is widely known. Rebel forces in Syria have declared Damascus “free,” claiming Bashar al-Assad has fled the capital, according to a statement on Sunday. “We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,” the Military Operations Command wrote in a post on Telegram. “To the displaced all over the world, a free Syria awaits you,” the statement added. The rebels earlier claimed to have entered the capital and taken control of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus. Syrian rebels fighting against the government of Bashar al-Assad claim they have taken control of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus, according to a statement on Sunday. “We broke the news to the Syrian people of liberating our prisoners and unchaining them, and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Saydnaya Prison,” the statement said. Amnesty International dubbed ” in a 2017 report after extensively documenting mass hangings there. A in July 2023 highlighted the “continuing widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including enforced disappearances” inside Syrian detention facilities including Saydnaya. Syrian rebels are moving to capture state media offices in Damascus, according to a statement on Sunday morning. “The Military Operations Command is moving to seize control of the Radio and Television Building to broadcast the victory announcement over Assad,” the statement said. Earlier in the evening the rebel alliance posted a message to its official Telegram account claiming its “forces began entering the capital.” A resident of the Barzeh neighborhood of Damascus told CNN that rebels were in the area and clashes were taking place. Scenes of chaos unfolded inside Damascus airport early Sunday morning local time, as Syrian rebel forces continued their lightning advance into the capital city. Footage verified by CNN showed dozens of people quickly passing through security checkpoints and rushing to departure gates in an attempt to flee the country. The airport appeared to be largely unstaffed and flight monitoring websites showed no imminent departures scheduled. Syria’s rebel coalition consists of Islamist and moderate factions who, despite their differences, are united in fighting the Assad regime, ISIS and Iran-backed militias. Here are some of the groups forming the coalition: The most prominent and formidable of the groups is HTS, also known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant. HTS was founded by , a military commander who gained experience as a young fighter for al Qaeda against the United States in Iraq. He created Jabhat al-Nusra, al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, and operated the group until a public split with in 2016 over ideological differences and opposition to ISIS. Jolani formed HTS in 2017. Despite Jolani’s effort to distance HTS from al Qaeda and ISIS, the US and other Western countries designated it a terrorist organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on him. The “Syrian National Army” incorporates dozens of factions with various ideologies that receive funding and arms from Turkey. That coalition includes the , comprising factions like Ahrar al-Sham whose stated aims are to “overthrow the (Assad) regime” and “establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law.” Complicating matters is that some members of the rebel coalition are also fighting Kurdish forces. The Turkish-backed said last week it had seized control of the city of and other towns and villages in the northern part of the Aleppo governorate. Those territories were previously held not by Assad’s government but by another faction involved in the multi-front civil war: the . The SDF are largely made up of Kurdish fighters from a group known as the (YPG), which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey. In Syria’s south, fighters from the country’s have also joined the fight, a local activist group told CNN. Druze are fighting in the southern city of as-Suwayda, which neighbors the Daraa province, where opposition forces claim to have taken control of Daraa city. A Syrian faction’s political leader who attended the 2015 peace talks in Geneva has laid out a possible political road map for if President Bashar al-Assad’s regime completely topples. Salem al-Meslet is the former president of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a group of opposition factions that came together in unity with the goal of overthrowing the Assad regime. He told CNN there would first be a withdrawal of all armed factions outside the cities and only civil police would exist. The plan would be to “work hard on preserving and protecting all state institutions” and keeping all employees in their positions, Meslet, who was also the Syrian Interim Government president, told CNN. A transitional body would be in place to lead for a period of six to nine months, followed by elections for a new parliament and civilian leadership. But given the rapid rise of rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), it’s unclear how much influence this faction will have. HTS was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate and is the driving the armed opposition now. In the early hours of Sunday, Rebel forces appear to have entered the Syrian capital of Damascus, one resident told CNN, as the Assad regime’s defenses showed signs of collapsing. A second source familiar with the rebels’ advance said Damascus appears to have fallen militarily. Rebel forces appear to have entered the Syrian capital of Damascus, one resident told CNN, as the Assad regime’s defenses showed signs of collapsing. “The rebels are in Barzeh,” a neighborhood inside Damascus city, the resident told CNN, adding that clashes were currently taking place. “I saw rebel fighters moving through the inner alleys of Barzeh toward Police Club Street, and I can hear very loud sounds of clashes. The electricity is cut off, and the internet is very weak, people are staying at their houses.” “Militarily, Damascus has fallen,” a source familiar with the rebels’ advance told CNN. Reconnaissance units had entered Damascus overnight searching for President Bashar al-Assad but were unable to find him, the source added. Special rebel operatives have entered Damascus and are taking up key positions in “strategic places,” the source said. The rebels say they are in touch with senior Assad regime elements who are . Through the day, anti-regime forces have been moving from the north, south and east toward Damascus, reaching suburbs less than 5 miles — and in one case, barely 1 mile — from the center of the Syrian capital. Syria’s main rebel group says it will now focus on Damascus, after capturing four cities in a day to the south and north of the capital. “We were able to liberate four Syrian cities within 24 hours: Daraa, Quneitra, Suwayda and Homs, and our operations are continuing to liberate the entire Damascus countryside, and our eyes are on the capital, Damascus,” spokesperson Lt. Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani said early Sunday morning local time. The armed uprising in Syria comprises , from the Military Operations Command — which began in the northwest and has since captured the major cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs — to southern rebel groups that joined the fight as recently as Friday. Within the last hour, the Military Operations Command said it had “fully liberated” the city of Homs. On Friday, a new rebel group began a fresh offensive in the southern Daraa province and swiftly captured Daraa city, before sweeping through the countryside and reaching the outskirts of Damascus. Also on Friday, in the neighboring Suwayda province, Syria’s Druze religious minority joined the fight against the Assad regime. By Saturday evening, the rebel groups had begun to encircle Damascus and were active in several pockets of the city’s suburbs, just a few miles from the presidential palace in the center. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Saturday the United States is “not going to dive into” the ongoing civil war in Syria but will “take steps” to prevent any potential resurgence of ISIS. His comments come amid a lightning offensive by Syrian rebels. “The United States is not going to dive into the middle, militarily dive into the middle, of a Syrian civil war. What we are going to do is focus on the American national security priorities and interests,” Sullivan said during a fireside chat at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California. Sullivan added that while the US will not take a side in the ongoing civil war, it will take necessary steps to prevent the resurgence of ISIS in northeast Syria and support regional allies. “The first, critically is, do not let this allow for the resurgence of ISIS, and we are going to take steps to make sure that that happens,” Sullivan said. “Second, we do have a profound interest in shoring up the security of our partners in the region, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, others – we’ll do that. And third, we will attend to the humanitarian situation because we believe that we have an obligation to do that.” His comments come after President-elect Donald Trump called for the US to stay out of any potential regime change and let the conflict unfold. Sullivan also noted that Biden administration was in “vigorous agreement” with Trump’s analysis in the post that the events in Syria are a result of the drain on Russia’s resources because of the war in Ukraine. He reiterated that officials are concerned about what comes next given that the group in the vanguard of the rebel forces is designated by the US as a terrorist organization. “(It) has had elements affiliated with groups that have American blood on their hands,” Sullivan said. When asked how concerned the administration is about potential spillover effects on the region, Sullivan acknowledged that “it is a concern” and one officials are watching closely. “Homs city is fully liberated,” Syria’s main rebel group said in the early hours of Sunday morning local time. The announcement by spokesperson Lt. Col. Hassan Abdel Ghani came just two days after the main rebel group captured the city of Hama, to the north of Homs. Videos from Homs have shown residents taking to the streets to celebrate. Syrians have been seen tearing down posters of President Bashar al-Assad in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy protests in the city during the more than a decade ago. Videos geolocated by CNN showed residents of Homs — Syria’s third-largest city — tearing apart posters of Assad and his father, the former President Hafez al-Assad, on top of the gates to the Officers’ Club in the city center. The scenes recall one of the most symbolic images from the Arab Spring in Syria, when pro-democracy protesters tore down Assad posters on top of the same gates in 2011. Nearby, residents were also seen celebrating in Clock Tower square, one of the focal points of anti-Assad protests during the Arab Spring. To stamp out the protests in Homs, the Syrian regime army launched a brutal assault on the city’s Khalidiya neighborhood in 2012, using tanks and mortars to attack civilian homes, causing some to collapse. Regime troops stormed the area, slaughtering families in their homes. Around 200 people are thought to have died in the massacre. In a video live-streamed from Clock Tower square by a resident late Saturday, Syrians were seen tearing a poster of Assad before stamping on and setting fire to it. Another resident threw a framed portrait of Assad on the ground, shattering its glass. Over the course of 10 minutes, Syrians filled the square, chanting in celebration at the growing apparent collapse of the Assad regime. Many were seen falling to the ground in prayer while cars honked their horns. Syrian rebels say senior Assad regime officials are preparing to defect to them in the capital Damascus as they press on with their stunning advance. “A group of senior regime officials and officers in the capital, Damascus, are coordinating with us to secure their defection,” Lt. Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani, a spokesperson for the Military Operations Command, said in a statement late Saturday. “This has led to a state of distrust among the regime’s military leaders, with accusations of betrayal and collaboration with the revolutionaries being exchanged,” he added. CNN has not yet been able to verify his claim. The Military Operations Command formed a little over a week ago, but its progress has been swift. After capturing Aleppo last week, its forces captured Hama on Thursday and on Saturday claimed to have entered Homs, as it proceeds along the major M5 highway leading to the capital Damascus. Meanwhile, the capital is increasingly encircled by southern rebel groups that only launched their offensive on Friday, but which have since swept through much of the southern countryside. Earlier Saturday, the southern rebels said they had reached “the gates” of Damascus. Syrian rebel factions have staged a lightning offensive in the country and have crept closer toward the capital of Damascus, in the most brazen challenge to in nearly a decade. Officials in US President Joe Biden’s administration, watching the remarkable speed of the Syrian rebel advance, increasingly see the possibility of Assad’s regime , five US officials told CNN. If that proves true, it would represent a spectacularly fast fall from power for the Syrian dictator after a civil war that began in 2011, one that had been relatively stagnant until just last week. Syrian rebels say they have entered the city of Homs, which — if captured — would effectively split President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in two, severing pockets of territory on the coast from the capital Damascus. “After several qualitative night operations, the remnants of the criminal regime are escaping the city of Homs, and the city’s neighborhoods are now being penetrated and combed in preparation for declaring it completely liberated, God willing,” a spokesperson for the northern rebels said around midnight local time on Saturday. The statement comes just two days after the rebels , to the north of Homs, and just over a week after they captured Aleppo. Meanwhile, southern rebel groups say they are working to encircling Damascus. After the rebels captured Hama, videos overnight into Friday showed hundreds of vehicles lining the highway out of Homs — Syria’s third-largest city — ahead of expected clashes between regime forces and the rebels. The , a US-backed coalition of rebel groups, said it has wrested “significant areas and positions” from government control in the east of the country and seized stockpiles of weapons. In a statement to CNN, the group said it captured the Jabal al-Ghuram mountain in eastern Syria, as well as “several checkpoints” along the M2 highway, which runs between the Syrian capital Damascus and the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Currently, the FSA is not part of the rebel groups encircling Damascus. The FSA said it had also “seized a variety of heavy and light weaponry,” including rocket launchers, tanks, field artillery, howitzers and large quantities of ammunition. It alleged that the Assad regime was “considering handing over these weapons to ISIS, which, along with the regime, works to destabilize the region, kill civilians and destroy the future of Syria.” The FSA did not provide evidence for its claim that the Assad regime might give its weapons to ISIS, the Islamist group that sprung up from the chaos during the civil war in Syria. Some observers have feared that the fluid situation in Syria, following the swift rebel offensive and looming collapse of the Assad regime, could lead to a resurgence of groups like ISIS. The FSA said it was “working to improve Syria’s future.” Syrian President Bashar al-Assad regime’s military has sent a message to residents assuring them that it will continue to defend the country, as rebels say they are circling in on the capital Damascus. “The Syrian Arab Army, as always, continues its national and constitutional duties to defend Syria and its people, and it will restore security and stability to all parts of our homeland,” the military said in a text sent via its cell providers across the country on Saturday evening. But some of the Syrian regime’s recent statements have appeared at odds with events on the ground. The Syrian regime has denied it is in retreat, but videos geolocated by CNN Assad regime forces leaving neighborhoods in Damascus just a few miles from the presidential palace. The Israeli military says it is monitoring the situation in Syria “very closely,” with a focus on “Iran’s movements and interests.” During a visit to the Syrian border Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israeli forces were not intervening in events in Syria, but were “working to thwart and prevent threats in the area, and preparing plans for various options,” according to a statement from the IDF. “The primary focus is on observing Iran’s movements and interests, which is our top priority,” Halevi said. “The secondary focus is on local (rebel) factions who are taking control of the area … and ensuring they do not mistakenly direct their actions toward us.” For the past decade or so, Iran has maintained a military presence in Syria as part of an effort to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power. It also uses the country as a supply route for channeling weapons to its regional proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon. Halevi also said Israel was reinforcing its troops along the Syria border, and its forces were “determined to prevent any violation of the sovereignty of the state of Israel.” Halevi’s remarks came after Israel said it had assisted United Nations forces in Syria in repelling an attack in an area close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Reacting to the incident, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar reiterated that Israel “does not intervene in the internal conflict in Syria.” Syria’s civil war is back in the spotlight after a new rebel coalition launched , capturing two major cities and eyeing the capital of Damascus, shattering the stalemate of a war that never formally ended. , which since 2011 has killed more than 300,000 and sent nearly six million refugees out of the country, has wide ramifications across the region and beyond. The 10-day lightning offensive caught many off guard in their attempt to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. But who is the Syrian dictator that the armed opposition groups are seeking to oust? Rebels in southern Syria have asked the Organization for the Prohibition on Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for help in disposing safely of a stockpile of chemical weapons built up by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. “The Syrian people have endured immense suffering and wounds due to the criminal use of internationally prohibited weapons by Bashar al-Assad’s regime against innocent civilians, in blatant violation of all international conventions and humanitarian values,” the southern Syrian rebels said in a statement Saturday. They called on the international community “to support the complete removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Syria.” The rebels said they wanted to cooperate with the OPCW and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, “to investigate the programs and stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction owned by Bashar al-Assad’s criminal regime.” However, it was not clear whether the southern rebels had taken control of weapons stockpiles at the time the statement was issued. : Multiple investigations by fact-finding teams from the OPCW have previously concluded the Syrian government forces were responsible for during the Syrian civil war. Iranian officials rejected reports that their ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has fled the country, as he is nowhere to be found in Damascus. “The news that Assad and his family left Syria is not true,” Yaqoub Rezazadeh, a member of the Iranian Parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committees said Saturday, according to Iranian state-owned Press TV. A source with knowledge of the situation told CNN Saturday that Assad in the city where you’d expect to find him. Assad’s Presidential Guard are no longer deployed at his usual place of residence, as they would be if he was there, the source said. The Syrian president’s office insists that Assad has not fled the capital. An adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met with Assad in Damascus on Friday, Press TV reported Saturday. Adviser Ali Larijani reportedly met with Assad to convey Iran’s support for the Syrian government amid the latest rebel uprising. Iranian officials also deny reports that their staff are evacuating the embassy in Damascus. “Those claims are not true,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said. “Iran’s embassy (in Damascus) is still operating and continues with its routine activities,” according to Press TV. “We have not evacuated our advisors and embassy [staff]. They are present in Damascus,” Rezazadeh said. He added that Iranian foreign ministry officials are traveling to Iraq and Qatar. Syrians living outside of the country have been seen celebrating the rebel offensive against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Outside the Russian Embassy in London on Saturday, a video showed dozens of Syrians waving “Free Syria” flags and chanting in celebration. Some held signs reading: “Enough with Assad.” Russia has been a staunch backer of Assad over more than a decade of civil war, but its military involvement in Syria since the rebel offensive began a week ago has been minimal. In Istanbul, Turkey, Syrians also lauded the rebels’ blows against the Assad regime. In one video, dozens of people were seen singing and dancing in a square in the city’s Bashakshehir neighborhood. One was waving a “Free Syria” flag. Turkey currently hosts some 3.2 million Syrian refugees. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime “is just around the corner,” according to a key rebel leader, who said Saturday he was advising his fighters to be “merciful” to civilians. “You have reached the threshold of Homs and Damascus, and the overthrow of the criminal regime is just around the corner, so I renew my advice to you, my brothers, to be merciful, kind, and gentle with our people in the cities and villages that you enter as humble conquerors,” the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), said in a statement. It was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate and is the driving the armed opposition. Despite Jolani’s effort to distance HTS from al Qaeda and ISIS, the US and other Western countries designated it a terrorist organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on him. Al-Jolani also stressed that all defecting regime army forces would be safe if they laid down weapons. “To the soldiers and officers of the Assad regime, whoever enters his home and closes his door … is safe, and whoever announces his defection from the criminal regime, puts down his weapon, and surrenders himself is safe,” al-Jolani said. As rebel groups say they are starting to encircle the capital, The Military Operations Command — the group of rebels that began an offensive last week from the northwest Idlib region — issued a warning to Assad. “We promise the criminal regime surprises awaiting it from the heart of the capital,” said Lt. Col. Hassan Abdel Ghani, a spokesperson for the rebels. Dozens of residents began to flee the upscale Mezzeh neighborhood, close to the Syrian capital Damascus, on Saturday, as rebel forces made gains through regime-held areas. Car headlights lit up a highway leading out of Mezzeh, just southwest of Damascus, in video geolocated by CNN. Groups of men carried their belongings and walked along a wide road, as night began to fall. Some of the pedestrians, who wore camouflage pants, appeared to be members of the Syrian military. The neighborhood is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Syrian presidential palace. “The army (regime) is withdrawing,” said one person, who is not in view. “The whole army withdrew.” A spokesperson for Syria’s rebel coalition — comprised of a disparate group of factions who share a common goal of deposing the Assad regime — said earlier that fighters are trying to surround the capital. Assad’s military has brushed off reports that government troops were withdrawing from the Damascus region. The Syrian regime called on residents across the country not to believe “false news” that it said aimed “to destabilize the security of the nation,” a Syrian Army general said in a televised statement aired on state media outlets Saturday. “The media platforms affiliated with the terrorists have not ceased spreading misleading videos and false news about the events taking place across Syrian territories,” according to the statement. The general, who is with the country’s defense ministry, said government forces “continue to carry out strategic operations against terrorist gatherings at a high pace in the directions of the Hama, Homs and northern Daraa countryside,” which he claimed have killed hundreds of rebel fighters. The media units of armed opposition groups have been posting videos on social media platforms showing cities and towns in southern and northern Syria under their control. The groups launched a lightning offensive over a week ago that caught many off guard in their attempt to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is nowhere to be found in Damascus, a source tells CNN. The official line of the Syrian president’s office is that Assad hasn’t fled the capital. But a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that Assad isn’t at any of the locations in the city where you’d expect to find him. Assad’s Presidential Guard are no longer deployed at his usual place of residence, as they would be if he was there, the source said, fueling speculation he may have escaped Damascus. Traditionally, this guard detail would provide Assad’s inner cordon of security, and some of them would be expected to travel with the president when he is on the move. According to the source, rebel forces have no solid intelligence on Assad’s location and are continuing their efforts to find him. The United Nations’ special envoy for Syria demanded an “inclusive and credible” transition of power on Saturday, as rebel fighters continued their rapid offensive toward Damascus. “The need for an orderly political transition has never been more urgent,” Geir O. Pedersen told a conference in the Qatari capital for the Doha Forum, an annual assembly of diplomats and policymakers. “We need an urgent serious process fundamentally different from what has gone on before,” said Pedersen. “This must be the start of a process that leads to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and the restoration of the sovereignty, independence, and unity, and territorial integrity of Syria.” Pedersen met with Iranian, Russian and Turkish government ministers, according to the statement, as well as representatives from the US, France, Britain, Germany and the European Union. “I reiterate my call for de-escalation, for calm, for the avoidance of bloodshed, and the protection of civilians in line with international humanitarian law,” he said. Residents in Irbin, a northwest suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus, have been seen celebrating the progress of anti-regime rebel fighters as they move closer to the city center. In a video geolocated by CNN, residents were observed flooding the streets, lighting fireworks and honking car horns. Irbin is just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the center of Damascus. Earlier, the southern rebels — who launched their offensive just a day ago — said they had reached . The Israeli military said it is currently assisting United Nations forces at its post in Syria in repelling an attack by “armed individuals.” “A short while ago, an attack was carried out by armed individuals at a UN post in the Hader area in Syria,” the Israeli military said in a Saturday statement. Syria’s Hader area is close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The military “is currently assisting the UN forces in repelling the attack,” the statement added. The Israeli military “is deployed with reinforced forces in the Golan Heights area and will continue to operate in order to protect the State of Israel and its citizens,” according to the statement. An Israeli military official told CNN Friday that there is air support only in the area and no ground troops involved at this time. Israel on Friday instructed its forces “to maintain a high level of preparedness and to continuously monitor the developments,” in Syria as rebels advance, the country’s defense ministry said in a statement Friday. Israel seized the strategic plateau from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967 before formally annexing it in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon. Syria’s capital Damascus is visible from atop the rocky Golan. The Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations. Syria’s armed opposition forces have vowed to protect United Nations offices and international organizations in the country, saying they are “institutions serving the people.” “We affirm that all government institutions, international organizations and United Nations offices operating on our land are institutions serving the people, and we have a duty to protect and preserve them, and even ensure the continuity of their work,” the rebel coalition led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) said in a statement on Saturday. The groups said it is their “responsibility and commitment to protect the interests of our people.” “We also affirm our keenness to ensure their safety and prevent any violations that may affect their work or hinder their development and service goals, in Aleppo, Hama, Homs, southern Syria and the rest of the Syrian cities,” the statement added. The armed opposition groups have seized several cities in southern and northern Syria during a 10-day lightning offensive that caught many off guard in their attempt to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Officials in US President Joe Biden’s administration, watching the remarkable speed of the Syrian rebel advance, increasingly see the possibility of Bashar al-Assad’s regime falling within days, five US officials told CNN. If the American analysis proves true, it would represent a spectacularly fast fall from power for the Syrian dictator after a war that began in 2011, one that had been relatively stagnant until just last week. Officials cautioned that there isn’t a formal assessment that has emerged on Assad’s fate and that views vary, saying his demise isn’t a forgone conclusion. “The emerging consensus is that is an increasingly plausible scenario,” one senior US official said. “Probably by next weekend the Assad regime will have lost any semblance of power,” one said. “Only thing that would delay a rebel conquest would be a well-organized coup and reorganization, but Assad’s folks have done a good job of stifling any potential competitors,” the official added. The Biden administration appeared caught off guard by the speed of the rebel advance that was launched last week. Regime troops have collapsed and melted away, leaving a fragile shell of an army to defend the president and Damascus. The US has misjudged the staying power of regimes before, most recently in Afghanistan — where the US intelligence community judged that the Afghan government would be more resilient than it ultimately was — and in Ukraine, which the US wrongly believed would fall to Russia within days of Russia’s invasion. As a result, in 2022, the US intelligence launched a review of how it assesses the “will to fight” of foreign militaries, CNN has previously reported. Syria’s anti-regime rebels say they have reached “the gates of Damascus,” just a day after launching an offensive in the country’s southern Daraa region. In a statement shortly after 7 p.m. local time on Saturday, the rebel Free Syrian Army group said its fighters are “at the gates” of the Syrian capital. The southern Syrian rebels began their offensive in Daraa early Friday. In a little over a day, they have gobbled up territory in the southern countryside and now appear to be just a few miles from the city center. Videos geolocated by CNN show rebels have been active in several pockets of the outer southern suburbs of Damascus since earlier Saturday afternoon. In Moadamyeh, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) southwest of the city center, locals were seen celebrating on the streets after driving regime forces out of their suburb, which is near a military airport. Rebels have also claimed control of Darayya, slightly west of Moadamyeh. In Jaramana, to the southeast, residents earlier of the father of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, former President Hafez al-Assad. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey wishes that neighboring Syria can “quickly attain the peace and tranquility it has longed for” during 13 years of civil conflict. Syrian rebel factions have staged a lightning offensive in the northwest of the country and in recent days crept closer toward the capital Damascus, in the most brazen challenge to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in nearly a decade. “I want to say this openly: We do not have our eyes on land — not even a pebble — that belongs to another country,” Erdogan said Saturday in Gaziantep, a southern Turkish city close to the Syrian border. “As Turkey, our wish is for our neighbor Syria to quickly attain the peace and tranquility it has longed for for 13 years,” he added. The city is home to about 500,000 Syrian refugees among the 12 million Syrians who have been displaced by the war. Erdogan said that “history will remember the hospitality of Gaziantep.” “Our Syrian siblings have really gone through hard days, they have paid heavy costs … An estimated 1 million Syrians have lost their lives due to the Syrian regime and the terrorist groups,” he said, condemning the use of and barrel bombs. Discussing the onset of the rebel offensive last week, Erdogan said: “It seems the increasing attacks on civilians in Idlib was like the straw that broke the camel’s back and triggered the latest developments.” “Everyone must accept that in Syria, political and diplomatically, there is a new reality,” he added. Syria’s armed rebels are attempting an operation to encircle the capital of Damascus, while the Syrian military denied that its forces are withdrawing from the capital region. After seizing Aleppo and Hama, rebel forces now appear to be speeding from the north toward the major city of , with residents fleeing ahead of potential clashes between opposition and regime fighters. Separate factions of rebels were also battling Syrian forces in the south of the country. Those opposition forces claim to have taken control of Daraa city in southwestern Syria — where the country’s 2011 uprising erupted. A resident of Damascus has described a state of fear and alarm among people in the Syrian capital, as anti-government rebels continue to tear through regime-held territory. “Damascus is in a state of tension and panic,” the resident, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, told CNN on Saturday. “People are anxiously waiting to see what will happen, unsure of what to do.” Some roads were blocked and shops in their neighborhood near the city center were closed, according to the resident, while food supplies were largely unavailable. Meanwhile, communications are functioning intermittently. The military presence in the capital has “significantly decreased,” the resident said, adding that a few troops remain at checkpoints. However, many soldiers are “changing out (of) their uniforms into civilian clothes.” Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s military has rebuffed reports that government troops were withdrawing from the Damascus region. Earlier on Saturday, rebel fighters claimed to have seized the southwestern city — the birthplace of the 2011 uprising. Armed fighters later penetrated the town , in the Damascus countryside, as the rebel coalition clawed closer toward the capital. President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on the escalating situation in Syria Saturday, : “THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!” Trump also argued that if Syrian rebels are able to force President Bashar al-Assad out of power, “it may actually be the best thing that can happen” to Russia, which he argued is too preoccupied with its war in Ukraine to stop the rebel fighters. The president-elect also blamed former US President Barack Obama’s administration for what he said was failing to which stated that Syria’s use of chemical weapons would mean US military action. Reiterating his “America First” stance, Trump argued that Syria is not the United States’ fight. “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend,” he wrote, urging a hands-off approach. Throngs of demonstrators toppled a colossal sculpture of the father of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the southern city of Jaramana Saturday, after regime forces retreated from the area just south of the capital Damascus. A protester could be seen climbing atop a huge facade showing the face of former President Hafez al-Assad, as dozens of men chanted and clapped in the foreground, according to footage geolocated by CNN. Others ferociously hammered parts of the statue, scattering broken pieces of material. The sound of gunfire can be heard overhead. In one video, a man is seen waving the blue, yellow, red, white and green colors of the . The outburst of celebrations came as Assad’s troops retreated from Jaramana, according to the activist group Suwayda 24. Rebel factions have crept closer to the strategic capital in recent days — in the most brazen challenge to the regime’s autocracy in nearly a decade. Hours earlier, Druze rebel fighters were the city of as-Suwaydya, just south of Jaramana. Last summer, residents in as-Suwaydya staged a rare string calling for regime change, with some people crying: “Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad.” By taking up arms in the latest rebel swing, Druze forces are bolstering the bubbling southern offensive. More than 1,000 Syrian army soldiers have arrived in Iraq through a border crossing in eastern Syria, a statement by Iraq’s state news agency said, citing a military source. “Iraq has received more than a thousand Syrian army soldiers today through the Al-Qaim border crossing in Anbar Province,” the source said, according to the Iraqi news agency. “The soldiers were received, provided with the necessary care, and their needs were met,” the source added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has not departed from Damascus, despite the fact that a rebel advance towards the capital city is gathering pace, Syria’s presidency said. “Some foreign media outlets are spreading rumors and false news about President Bashar al-Assad leaving Damascus, or making quick visits to another country,” the presidency said in a Saturday statement. “The president is following up on his work and national and constitutional duties from the capital, Damascus,” it added. Russia is attempting to do “everything” it can so as “not to allow terrorists to prevail” in Syria, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Saturday. Russian jets have been assisting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in striking rebel fighters since 2015, including when armed opposition rebels launched their latest offensive last week. When asked if Moscow was worried about rebels taking the Syrian city of Homs, Lavrov said that he is “not in the business of guessing what is going to happen.” “We are trying to do everything not to allow terrorists to prevail, even if they say that they are no longer terrorists,” he continued. Lavrov also criticized , the militant leader of the main group driving Syria’s armed opposition. “We checked with the Americans whether he’s still on the US terrorist list, and they said yes, he is, in addition to the (United Nations) Security Council terrorist list. So giving him the audience of CNN is already something,” Lavrov said. “Militarily, Russia helps the Syrian army with the air force… and we help the Syrian army to counter the attacks of terrorists. What is the forecast? I cannot guess. We are not in the business of guessing.” Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad did not seize an opportunity to reconcile his relationship with the Syrian people during a period when the country’s civil war had quietened, according to Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. “We had an opportunity in that time when the war over there has calmed down, yet Assad didn’t seize that opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,” Al Thani told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in a panel at a conference in Doha, Qatar’s capital. “We didn’t see any serious movement on the return of the refugees or reconciling with his people,” Al Thani said. Rebel forces in Syria are currently advancing quickly to capture cities previously controlled by Assad in both the north and south of the country. At least four cities have been captured by opposition troops over the past 10 days. The Qatari prime minister, who also serves as the country’s foreign minister, said in reference to the rebel offensives that “everyone around the world… is surprised on how they are advancing and how fast they are progressing.” Al Thani called for a political and sustainable solution to the crisis. “Our worries (are) that this will bring us back to the old cycles of internal violence and civil war, which would threaten the territorial integrity of the state of Syria,” he said. “Honestly it’s going to damage and destroy what’s left if there’s no sense of urgency to start putting a political framework to what’s happening over there.” Opposition faction fighters penetrated the town of Kanaker, in the Damascus countryside, on Saturday, as the rebel alliance edged closer to the capital. A volley of bullets can be heard in footage geolocated by CNN, before armed men point their guns towards the sky. The rebel alliance is fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s troops from the northern and southernmost parts of the country, surrounding Damascus. The rebels’ claim that they are encircling the capital has not been verified by CNN, but follows tangible signs of advances in the southwestern city of Daraa – where the uprising erupted in 2011. Further north, armed rebel fighters entered the central city of Palmyra on Saturday, as anti-regime forces leapt through patches of government-held territory in a 10-day offensive. In video geolocated by CNN, armed men could be seen trundling down a dusty, open pathway. The city of Palmyra is an archaeological landmark, which traces back to the Neolithic period. After seizing Aleppo and Hama, Syrian rebel forces now appear to be speeding from the north toward the major city of , with residents fleeing ahead of potential clashes between opposition and regime fighters. Elsewhere, separate factions of rebels were also battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in the south of the country. Those opposition forces claim to have taken control of Daraa city in southwestern Syria, inching closer to the capital Damascus. Rebel factions representing the Druze sect in Daraa’s neighboring city of as-Suwayda also launched an offensive against Syrian regime forces there. The southern factions are different from factions in the north led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which took both Aleppo and Hama during its offensive that started over a week ago. Still, those groups aim for the same goal, which is toppling Assad. Here’s the status of their control as of Friday: Syria’s armed rebels are attempting an operation to encircle the capital Damascus, a spokesperson said on Telegram. Hassan Abdulghani, the spokesperson of the rebel coalition led by the Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) group, said the “final phase” of their operation to “encircle” Damascus had started. CNN could not verify that claim. The Syrian military denied that their forces are withdrawing from the Damascus region, calling reports of their retreat “a false media campaign… by armed terrorist organizations… with the aim of spreading panic and fear among civilians in the Damascus countryside.” The renewed fighting in Syria’s civil war, which has killed more than 300,000 people and sent nearly 6 million refugees out of the country since 2011, will have wide ramifications across the Middle East and beyond. At the height of the Arab Spring in 2011, pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets in Syria calling for the ouster of its authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad. The protesters were met with deadly force. As Assad’s forces crushed the pro-democracy movement, an armed opposition began to form, made up of small organic militias and some defectors from the Syrian military. The opposition forces — which are decentralized and made up of different ideologies, but with a common goal of toppling Assad — were supported in various ways by foreign powers including neighboring Turkey, regional giants Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. As the anti-government forces grew, Syria’s allies Iran and Russia stepped up their support. On the ground, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — as well as its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah — helped fight the armed rebel groups. In the skies, the Syrian Air Force was bolstered by Russian warplanes. By 2014, extremist groups outweighed moderates within the opposition coalition, and ISIS began sweeping across the country. Fearing Syria would become a permanent terror hotbed, an international coalition led by the US stepped in with a focus on eliminating the group, but without confronting the Syrian regime. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) — a US partner made up of Kurdish fighters — fought against ISIS, effectively ending the group’s territorial existence. In 2020, Russia and Turkey to a ceasefire in their proxy battle over the last remaining opposition-held province, Idlib. There have been no major flare-ups since, but Syria’s government never regained all of its territory. And as events in Aleppo show, armed resistance never completely went away. The offensive began after rebels formed a new coalition called the “Military Operations Command.” They quickly swept through villages outside Aleppo, and residents have now said they control much of the city, meeting little resistance on the way. The fighters say they are seeking to liberate occupied territory and were responding to stepped up attacks from government forces and pro-Iranian militia groups. © 2024 Cable News Network.

And it comes with added anticipation this year as, for the first time ever, 12 teams will be competing for a place in the College Football Playoff Championship Game instead of four. On Sunday, a 13-person committee will release its final , determining the field for this year’s playoffs. So, ahead of the first-of-its-kind event, here is everything you need to know. Previously, the CFP ran for just two rounds with four teams involved, with an expanded field allowing more teams to compete for a national championship. In this new format, the five highest-ranked conference champions and the next seven highest-ranked teams will fill the 12 spots in the bracket. There is no limit to how many teams from one conference can qualify – and it looks as if the Big Ten and SEC will dominate the field. The final CFP rankings will not necessarily reflect the seeding of the 12 teams in the tournament. The top four conference champions will get a first-round bye into the quarterfinal round. If a team is ranked in the top four but is not a conference champion, it will be seeded fifth and will play in two weeks in the first round of the playoffs. Once the seeds have been set, to a first round game on December 20 or December 21 at the home stadiums of the highest seeds. The four highest-ranked conference champions — likely Boise State, Georgia, Oregon and Arizona State, who all won this weekend in their conference championship games — are to be the top four seeds and will each receive a first-round bye. Boise State guaranteed its spot in the playoffs by winning a second consecutive Mountain West Conference title on Friday, defeating No. 19 UNLV 21-7 behind yet another outstanding performance from running back Ashton Jeanty. The junior is likely to be in New York next week as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, the award for college football’s best player. He has already produced one of the and added 209 yards on to take his season total to 2,497, within touching distance of the all-time FBS record. While Boise State is not from one of the traditional football powerhouse conferences — the Southeastern, Big Ten, Big 12 and Atlantic Coast conferences – it will likely be ranked ahead of ACC champion Clemson, thus earning a first-round bye. Georgia took down Texas in overtime in a classic SEC championship game, likely earning a first-round bye and relegating the Longhorns to playing a home game in two weeks. Oregon did what was expected and beat Penn State in the Big Ten Championship Game, continuing their unbeaten season. The unlikely team getting a first round bye is the Arizona State University Sun Devils, who were largely expected to finish last in their first season in the Big 12 but instead won the conference championship and will potentially be ranked ahead of Clemson, which won the ACC championship game but has three losses. While the receive a first-round bye, the No. 5-8 seeds will get home games in the first round. Before the conference games over the weekend, Georgia, Ohio State, Tennessee and SMU occupied these spots. With their win, the Bulldogs will rest next weekend, and Texas will likely play in Austin in the first round. Penn State’s loss to Oregon means the Nittany Lions will be playing at Beaver Stadium in Happy Valley. Penn State was ranked third in the penultimate CFP rankings, but are unlikely to drop out of the top eight of the rankings after a high-scoring game against the Ducks in Indianapolis. Notre Dame was ranked No. 4 in the CFP’s penultimate rankings, but will not get a first-round bye because it is not a member of a conference. As an independent, Notre Dame is not eligible for a first round bye. The Irish are very likely to be in the top eight and host a game at historic Notre Dame Stadium. Ohio State and Tennessee finished the regular season as No. 6 and No. 7 respectively, and it’ll be a tough decision for the committee to figure out which team is going to get a first round home game. Ultimately, this is the toughest question for the committee to answer and is sure to be a hot-button issue for fans and talking heads alike in the coming weeks before playoff games kick off. The fate of some teams will come down to the wire. Alabama was ranked No. 11 in the committee’s , scraping into the playoff spots ahead of Miami after the Hurricanes shocking loss to Syracuse on November 30. That result ended any hopes that No. 12 Miami, No. 13 Ole Miss and No. 14 South Carolina might have had of making the playoffs. Alabama, though, still has a shot at making the CFP. SMU will be watching with bated breath as well. After a devastating loss to Clemson in the ACC championship, the Mustangs are counting on their conference championship game appearance to carry them into postseason play. Indiana University will also be watching closely. The Hoosiers finished the season with just one loss and were ranked No. 9 in the penultimate CFP rankings. But, Indiana is fighting against a softer strength of schedule and a lesser historical reputation than many of the blue bloods who could be left on the outside looking in. The Hoosiers believe they’ve done enough to earn a playoff berth, but tension will be high in Bloomington. As mentioned above, Georgia’s win over Texas means that they’re going to be able to rest up and wait to play on either New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in the semifinals. The Longhorns will now have to play in the first round. Arizona State’s win in the Big 12 championship game over Iowa State has sent the Cyclones home for the season. With three losses coming into the game at At&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, they needed a win over the Sun Devils to sneak into the final field of 12. The result that shook up the field the most is Clemson University’s thrilling win over SMU in the ACC championship game. The Tigers guaranteed themselves a spot in the field of 12 with a walk-off field goal as time expired, having just given up a 17-point lead to the Mustangs. But a vital kickoff return put Clemson in position and a clutch 56-yard field goal sent them to the postseason. The result means SMU — who finished the regular season ranked No. 8 in the CFP rankings — now hopes it will not be penalized for playing in and losing its conference championship game while a team like Alabama sat at home watching. The impending decision on whether to punish a team for losing its conference championship game sets up the first big test for the selection committee in the 12-team format. For all the stars taking to the field in the playoffs, there will be a notable one missing. Colorado’s Travis Hunter, whose extraordinary capabilities on both sides of the ball have made him the front-runner for this year’s Heisman Trophy, will miss out on the playoffs as his team didn’t make the Big 12 Championship game. Colorado was the with a 9-3 record in Tuesday’s rankings, far away from any potential CFP spot. The Buffaloes were in the mix for a playoff spot but ultimately missed their chance. Hunter is also expected to be in New York with Jeanty and the two-way star is the front-runner for the Heisman, a potential feather in the cap of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders in his second season in charge of the Colorado program. Sanders was a star on defense and offense during his own playing career. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Assad is known for a brutal rule over Syria, which since 2011 has been devastated by a civil war that ravaged the country and turned it into a breeding ground for extremist group ISIS, while sparking an international proxy war and that saw millions displaced from their homes. War began after Assad’s regime refused to bow to mass pro-democracy protests that year during the Arab Spring, instead mounting a brutal crackdown on the peaceful movement – in the first few months alone. Assad’s forces have since been accused of severe human rights violations and brutal assaults against civilians throughout the 13-year war, including the use chemical weapons against their own people. The United States, Jordan, Turkey and the European Union at the war’s start all called for Assad to step down. But the heavily Western-sanctioned and internationally isolated regime has clung to power until now thanks to the Russia and Iran, and a merciless campaign against opposition. Testament to the horror of that regime were as rebel forces took control of Syrian cities. In Homs, videos geolocated by CNN showed residents tearing apart posters of Assad and his father in scenes that recalled symbolic images from 2011. Assad took power in an unopposed election in 2000 following the death of his father Hafez al-Assad, who rose from poverty to lead the Baath Party and seized power in 1970, becoming the country’s president the following year. The younger Assad grew up in the shadow of his father, a Soviet ally who ruled Syria for three decades and helped propel a minority Alawite population to key political, social and military posts. Like the son who succeeded him, Hafez al-Assad tolerated little dissent with oppression widespread and periodic bouts of extreme state violence. In 1982 in the city of Hama – – Hafez al-Assad had his army and intelligence services slaughter thousands of his opponents, ending an uprising led by the Muslim Brotherhood. As a second son not poised to take up his father’s mantle, Assad studied ophthalmology in London until his older brother Bassel, who had been groomed to succeed Hafez, died in a car crash in 1994. Bashar al-Assad was then thrust into the national spotlight and studied military science, later becoming a colonel in the Syrian army. After his father’s death in June 2000, it took just hours for the Syrian parliament to change the constitution to lower the presidential age of eligibility from 40 to Assad’s age at the time of 34, a move that allowed him to succeed his father after opposition-less elections the following month. Many observers in Europe and the United States seemed heartened by the incoming president, who presented himself as a fresh, youthful leader who might usher in a more progressive, moderate regime. Assad’s wife, Asma al-Assad, whom he married in 2000, a former investment banker of Syrian descent who grew up in London, helped burnish that view. But Western hopes of a more moderate Syria sank when the new leader promptly maintained his country’s traditional ties with militant groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. They then turned to outright condemnation of the regime after he met the 2011 pro-democracy groundswell with brutal force. In May 2011, then US President Barack Obama said Assad’s regime had “chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens” and called on him to lead a democratic transition “or get out of the way.” Assad has been re-elected by sweeping majorities every seven years, most recently in 2021 in what the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy deemed a “fraudulent election.” Assad’s forces were known for brutal tactics during the civil war that ensued after the crackdown on 2011 pro-democracy protests, when an armed opposition made up of small organic militias and some defectors from the Syrian military formed. On 2013, UN weapons inspectors returned “overwhelming and indisputable” evidence of the in Syria. Then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the August 21 attack described in the report, which took place in the Damascus suburbs, “the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century.” The United States said that attack may have killed more than 1,400, including hundreds of civilians. Syrian officials have allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The attack and others galvanized world powers to work to dismantle the regime’s chemical arsenal and pushed the US in 2013 to up its support for Syrian opposition forces, following what Washington said was the crossing of a “red line.” Assad against supporting rebel groups battling his armed forces, predicting the militants would one day strike against the US and others. Later, in 2015 the leader said Syria a US-led coalition focused on destroying terror group ISIS, which took control of parts of the war-torn country during the war. The conflict is now a cornerstone of Assad’s brutal legacy, leaving hundreds of thousands of dead, and what the United Nations earlier this year said was more than 7 million internally displaced and over 6 million international refugees. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The startling advance of opposition in a week is the unintended consequence of two other conflicts, one near and one far. It leaves several key US allies with a new and largely unknown Islamist-led force, governing swathes of their strategic neighbor – if not most of it, given the pace of events, by the time you read this. Syria has absorbed so much diplomatic oxygen in the past 20 years, it is fitting this week of sweeping change popped up as if from a vacuum. Since the invasion of Iraq, the US has struggled to find a policy for Syria that could accommodate the vastly different needs of its allies Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and its sometime partners Iraq and Lebanon. Syria has always been the wing-nut of the region: linking Iraq’s oil to the Mediterranean, the Shia of Iraq and Iran to Lebanon, and NATO’s southern underbelly Turkey to Jordan’s deserts. George W Bush put it in his Axis of Evil; Obama didn’t want to touch it much in case he broke it further; Donald Trump bombed it once, very quickly. It has been in the grip of a horrifically brutal dictatorship for decades. Hama, Homs, Damascus – all again in the headlines overnight because of the regime’s swift fall, yet too home to the most heinous parts of its history – respectively the 1982 massacre of 20,000 in Hama, or the 2012 siege and then starvation of Homs, or the gassing with Sarin in Ghouta, near Damascus, of children in basements in 2013. Then there was ISIS from 2014 to 2017. There seemed little more you could subject Syria to, until this week brought it liberation, thus far at an unknown cost, with vast caveats. The swiftly changing fate of Bashar al-Assad was not really made in Syria, but in southern Beirut and Donetsk. Without the physical crutches of Russia’s air force and Iran’s proxy muscle Hezbollah, he toppled when finally pushed. Israel’s brutal yet effective two-month war on Hezbollah probably did not pay much mind to Assad’s fate. But it may have decided it. Likewise, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 34 months ago, likely considered little how few jets or troops it might leave Moscow to uphold its Middle Eastern allies with. But the war of attrition has left Russia “incapable” of assisting Assad, even President-elect Donald Trump noted on Saturday. And indeed Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cut a weakened figure this weekend, saying: “What is the forecast? I cannot guess. We are not in the business of guessing.” These are not the words of a steadfast and capable guarantor, rather those of a regional power seeing its spinning plates hit the floor. Iran has been wildly hamstrung in the past six months, as its war with Israel, usually in the shadows or deniable, evolved into high-stakes and largely ineffective long-range missile attacks. Its main proxy, Hezbollah, was crippled by a on its hierarchy, and then by weeks of vicious airstrikes. Tehran’s pledges of support have done little so far but result in a joint statement with Syria and Iraq on “a need for collective action to confront” the rebels. The Middle East is reeling because ideas taken as a given – like pervasive Iranian strength, and Russian solidity as an ally – are crumbling as they meet new realities. Assad prevailed as the leader of a blood-drenched minority, not through guile or grit, but because Iran murdered for him and Moscow bombed for him. Now these two allies are wildly over-stretched elsewhere, the imbalance that kept Assad and his ruling Alawite minority at the helm is also gone. When established regional powers seem suddenly unable to act, there is often a moment of significant risk. But this is one seized by Turkey, a NATO member which has dealt with the most fallout from Syria’s turmoil. Ankara has had to play the long game over Syria, and housed over three million of its refugees since 2012. It has had to see the Kurdish militants – the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that the US trained, equipped and helped to fight ISIS – develop a stronghold along its border. From Ankara’s perspective, the Syria problem has never gone away even though attention to it faded; it would one day need to alter the enduring mess in its favor. The sweeping offensive by Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS) – with its impetus, equipment and inclusive communications strategy, telling Syria’s disparate and panicked ethnic groups their new society would view them all as one – spoke of a sophisticated hand behind it. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made his strongest suggestion to date whose hand that was when he said Friday he had tried to negotiate the future of Syria with Assad, failed, and he wished the offensive well, all the way to the Syrian capital. It was not a subtle message. But it does not need to be at a time of seismic change Erdogan has likely long awaited. Exactly who Turkey has empowered remains unclear. HTS’s upper echelons, in short, began as al-Qaeda, found ISIS too extreme, and are now trying to suggest they’ve grown up. From Ireland to Afghanistan, the history of this sort of evolution is messy. It’s not always simple for extremists to reform, yet also possible sometimes they can change just about enough. Separately, while Turkey may have lit the touch paper of HTS assaults, the speed of Assad’s collapse may not have been anticipated. There is such a thing as too great a success. The unknowable impact of vast, fast change left Syria mired in half-policies and US inaction before. Back in 2013, then-US President Barack Obama said he would retaliate militarily if Assad used chemical weapons, but did not enforce this “red line” when Assad deployed Sarin in Ghouta in 2013. His officials partially justified his walkback by suggesting too much further damage to the already frail Assad regime could let increasingly jihadist rebels to advance so fast, they could be in control of Damascus in months. It is possible they were right back then; it is yet more likely the failure by Obama to act emboldened Russia and Iran for years. We don’t know a lot about what is happening now in Syria or what it means. HTS may prove a better governor of Syria’s ethnic mix than Assad was, which won’t be hard. Assad may melt away into exile in a lavish row of Moscow dachas, and his hollow autocracy may crumble fast. Russia may lick its geopolitical wounds and concentrate on the catastrophic bleed that is its invasion of Ukraine. Iran may pause to reflect, and instead ready itself for the possible tsunami of aggression that could come with Trump’s White House. Obama’s argument was made to a Western audience exhausted by Iraq and Afghanistan, and preoccupied by terrorism. And it marked a form of war-weary isolationism, in which an over-stretched US was reluctant to instigate more change it could not control. Obama ended up funding and arming the Syrian opposition so feebly it was slaughtered and – when its extremists joined up with radicals from Iraq’s long-running insurgency against the US occupation – metastasized into ISIS. That was about the worst possible outcome. The West had played its hand so weakly in one low-grade conflict, it won the four-year industrial-strength horror of a war against the ISIS caliphate. This may prove the swift and severe change that Syria needed to stabilize – a shaking of the carpet that leaves society smoother. Syria’s past 13 years have been so brutal it deserves exactly that. Yet they have also proven how out of reach peace can be, and deep its suffering can go. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, is preparing to move quickly on two of the president-elect’s top issues — border security and energy production — while punting on a tax bill until later in 2025. But that’s caused deep anger among some senior House members, who warn that waiting on the tax issue could mean killing it altogether. And there’s a push among some conservative Republicans to toss all of Trump’s priorities into one catchall bill. But GOP critics warn that doing so would cause such a plan to collapse under its own weight — especially given the complexities of tax policy coupled with tight margins in the House, where one Republican defection could scuttle the entire agenda. The GOP will operate with one of the smallest congressional majorities in history while contending with major deadlines like averting a government shutdown as early as March and a potentially catastrophic debt default next year. And with just six weeks until Inauguration Day, Republicans across the party are growing anxious over how to deliver on Trump’s priorities in some of the toughest possible political conditions. ”This is a once in a generational opportunity to do a lot of things,” said Sen. John Cornyn, a senior Texas Republican who served as the whip in Trump’s first term. “And I am not sure everyone is on the same page.” The clash comes as House and Senate GOP leaders fully recognize they have little time to use the political capital Trump is eager to expend from his election victory. Yet while many Senate Republicans argue a narrow border and energy policy bill would help deliver an early win for Trump, many on the House side worry about squandering momentum for the rest of Trump’s agenda — namely, taxes. “I am worried that everyday Americans will face a tax increase if Congress doesn’t act appropriately,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a powerful chairman who leads the GOP’s tax-writing panel and wants Congress to focus on taxes in the first package. “The president campaigned on it. It’s a priority. They should listen to the 76 million Americans who asked for tax relief.” At a private meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday, Smith’s fellow GOP tax-writers agreed. Republicans in the room stressed that tax policy shouldn’t be left out because Congress might not get a “second bite at the apple,” according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. Despite one-party rule, there will still be limited chances to enact new policy through Congress without bipartisan support. Typically, any senator can filibuster legislation, which would require 60 votes to overcome in a Senate where Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority. Republicans are looking at passing the bill using the budget process, known on Capitol Hill as reconciliation, which allows bills to be approved by a simple majority (51 votes) in the Senate. But approving each reconciliation bill requires two steps and a marathon series of votes, and the legislation must pass muster with strict budget rules in the Senate. Typically reconciliation bills are attempted once a year during single-party rule in Congress. Smith argues history hasn’t been kind to majorities trying to do it twice — especially since Republicans will hold and will lose three more seats due to resignations early in the new year. “Like I said, if you look at history over the last 25 years, there’s not been two reconciliations that have been signed into law in the same year, and why would we think in a (220-215) majority … that we would over perform?” Smith told CNN. But many senators argue that jumpstarting Trump’s term with a border bill — packed with widely popular GOP ideas — is a better move politically than risking a dragged-out tax battle. “On tax, we always knew it was going to be very complicated. We want to do it right,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican up for reelection in 2026. “I have no objections to doing that secondary as long as we are working on it at the same time. It is going to take longer to get it done, but we want to do it correctly.“ Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who is also up for reelection in two years, added: “We won saying we want to solve the border so I think it’s good policy and good politics to say he wants to lead with it. When we do the tax reconciliation, it’s gonna be big and complex.” Sen. Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who used to serve in the House, said passing their agenda “will be complicated.” “Jason Smith doesn’t think that’s possible to take more than one bite of the apple,” she said. “And he may be right in the House. He has a pretty good read on how the House rolls. The House and the Senate don’t roll the same.” One of the most influential voices in the debate will be Speaker Mike Johnson, the soft-spoken GOP leader who will have zero votes to lose on the floor early next year — the narrowest House margin in history as the result of expected vacancies when some members leave to join the Trump administration. In an interview with CNN, Johnson didn’t take a position on how to sequence the bills, arguing that “we all have the same priorities” and indicating the talks with Senate leaders and Trump’s team were still taking shape. “Look, I can make a case for different sequences of how we do all these priorities, but my job here is to build consensus,” Johnson said. “So we’re working to do that in a bicameral fashion.” Asked about the challenges of passing the bills with no margin for error, Johnson quipped: “It’s going to be very easy. We know how to work with a small majority.” With the razor-thin majority, House Republicans may have an unusual amount of leverage in the typically Senate-driven process of crafting a filibuster-proof legislative package. (For President Joe Biden’s own version, party leaders were repeatedly forced to rewrite their bill thanks to Sen. Joe Manchin. For Trump, the trouble could come from the House chamber instead.) “They have a narrower margin than even we do, and so we may have to defer to the House a little bit,” Lummis said of the House, where she served eight years. “It’s really unusual,” the Wyoming Republican said. “It might take a new attitude adjustment over here.” GOP Rep. Kevin Hern, another Republican on the tax-writing panel, said he believes Johnson and other fellow House members will help make a strong case not to leave the tax issue behind. “You only get one bite at the apple and taxes are important to all Americans,” Hern said. “We understand the politics on this side of the House. I think the speaker, the Senate leader and our chairmen are working on that, to better understand how the House works.” Most of the GOP’s discussions on these bills have so far taken place at the leadership level. But Johnson plans to bring his members into the debate immediately after members’ swearing-in next month for the new Congress. Johnson will hold a Saturday members’ session on Trump’s legislative plans on January 4, according to people familiar with the plans. “I think what is going to matter the most is whether, between the two of them, Mike Johnson and Donald Trump can discipline whatever the number is and keep them united,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota. Top Hill Republicans have spent nearly a year trying to make sure Trump’s first-100-day agenda avoids the fate it had his first term, when his top priority — repealing the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare — failed in dramatic fashion. A group of House GOP chairmen first sat down in May to plot this massive package under a potential Trump presidency, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Since then, those Republicans have been drafting bills and compiling spreadsheets of ideas on how to pay for their plans. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee and Budget Committee have spent months preparing to manage what is expected to be an arduous fight to pass another tax bill, which will extend some of the provisions from the 2017 tax bill but could also include new provisions expected to cost billions. Trump has floated not taxing the tips workers make as well as not taxing Social Security payments to seniors, both of which would increase the price tag of any potential tax bill. Meanwhile, the Budget Committee has been focused on options to offset the cost of some of those provisions. A source familiar with the discussions says the committee has begun to identify potential spending cuts to pay for the tax bill, including repealing Biden’s executive order on student loans; issuing work requirements for able-bodied, childless working age recipients of Medicaid; and repealing some of the green energy tax incentives from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. But, as with any new spending cut, ensuring Republicans are united could be a massive lift with such a narrow majority. “My experience has been trying to convince people to cut it, it’s kind of like going to heaven,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said of spending cuts. “Everybody’s ready to go to heaven, but nobody’s willing to take the trip.” But even the GOP’s push to pass a border-focused bill may not be easy. Rep. Andrew Clyde, a member of the House Freedom Caucus who is a close Trump ally, told CNN that Republicans shouldn’t consider anything less than the House’s own hard-line border package, known as HR 2, even though such a plan could run afoul of the Senate’s budget rules. “I think HR 2 would be the floor of what we need,” Clyde said. And he added that he wants to see at least some tax policy in the package: “I think we can probably do a little bit of the tax aspect of it,” specifically citing Trump’s pledge to end taxes on tips. But even some veteran Senate Republicans warned that passing two reconciliation bills will be a tall order. “I think it’s going to be difficult,” said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the incoming chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The development came a day after Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him in parliament, with most ruling-party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers. The main opposition Democratic Party said it will prepare a new impeachment motion against Yoon. On Sunday, ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun was taken into custody at a Seoul detention facility after undergoing an investigation by prosecutors, a law enforcement official said, requesting anonymity in line with privacy rules. The official gave no further details. But South Korean media reported that Kim voluntarily appeared at a Seoul prosecutors’ office, where he had his mobile phone confiscated and was detained. The reports said police searched Kim’s former office and residence on Sunday. Repeated calls to Seoul prosecutors’ offices and police agency were unanswered. Senior prosecutor Park Se-hyun said in a televised statement Sunday that authorities launched a 62-member special investigation team on the martial law case. Park, who will head the team, said the probe would “leave no suspicions.” Yoon accepted Kim’s resignation offer on Thursday after opposition parties submitted a separate impeachment motion against him. Kim is a central figure in Yoon’s martial law enforcement, which led to special forces troops encircling the National Assembly building and army helicopters hovering over it. The military withdrew after the parliament unanimously voted to overturn Yoon’s decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. In Kim’s impeachment motion document, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties accused him of proposing martial law to Yoon. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho told parliament that Kim Yong-hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly. The Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition “unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.” It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and Kim Yong-hyun, over the alleged rebellion. In a statement Wednesday, Kim said that “all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me.” Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jung told reporters on Thursday the prosecution plans to investigate the rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. The Defense Ministry said it has suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in the martial law imposition. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, “including matters related to my term in office.” Since taking office in 2022 for a single five-year term, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a “den of criminals” bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. The turmoil has sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan. The scrapping of Yoon’s impeachment motion is expected to intensify protests calling for his ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president’s impeachment. Yoon’s martial law declaration drew criticism from the conservative ruling party, but it is determined to oppose Yoon’s impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals. Ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hun said Sunday the PPP will work with the government to determine Yoon’s early and orderly exit from office in a way that minimizes confusion, but he didn’t say when that would happen. He also claimed Yoon will not be involved in state affairs, including foreign policy. Yoon’s presidential office didn’t immediately respond. The Democratic Party criticized Han Dong-hun’s comments, saying that the exclusion of an incumbent president from state affairs isn’t supported by the constitution. The party said authorities should immediately arrest Yoon and all others implicated in the case. The presidential office said Sunday that Yoon accepted the resignation offer by Safety Minister Lee Sang-min, who has also faced an opposition-led impeachment motion over his alleged role in the martial law enforcement. In a parliamentary hearing on Friday, Lee, one of Yoon’s closest associates, defended Yoon’s martial law decree, saying the president exercised his powers “within the boundaries of constitutional processes and law.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The removal of Assad – who has not been heard from since the rebels’ claim – would bring an end to more than 50 years of his family’s autocratic rule of the nation of about 23 million, which has been buffeted and fractured by more than a decade of civil war. Celebratory gunfire was heard in Damascus, as word spread of Assad fleeing the capital. Footage shared on social media and verified by CNN showed similar scenes in Aleppo, which fell to the rebels just over a week ago as they launched a surprise lightning offensive which has since swept several major cities. The sheer speed of the rebel advance has caught much of the world off guard and brought about a stunning reordering of power in a Middle Eastern nation that has long been at the crossroads of a regional power struggle. Both Iran and Russia were supporters of the Assad regime and helped keep him in power during a grueling civil war that sparked one of the world’s largest recent refugee crises. The potential toppling of the Iran-backed Assad would follow the decimation of key Tehran proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in conflicts with Israel over the past 14 months. One US official told CNN that developments in Damascus marked the collapse of “Iran’s artifice” across the Middle East. National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett wrote on X that US President Joe Biden and his advisers were “closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners.” Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said the government stood ready “to cooperate with any leadership the people choose,” in a recorded message on Sunday morning. “We are ready to cooperate with any leadership the people choose, offering all possible support to ensure a smooth and systematic transition of government functions, preserving state facilities,” he said. Jalali also called on Syrians to protect public facilities, saying they belonged to all citizens. The militant leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the main group driving the country’s armed opposition, released a statement calling on rebel forces to leave state institutions unharmed. “To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former Prime Minister until they are officially handed over, and it is also forbidden to fire bullets into the air,” Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, wrote on Telegram. The rebels earlier claimed to have of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus. By early Sunday morning, a source familiar with the rebels’ advance told CNN: “Militarily, Damascus has fallen.” Hours before, HTS said it had “fully liberated” the major city of Homs, north of the capital. Syrians were seen and setting fire to posters of Assad after rebels had entered the city, in scenes reminiscent of pro-democracy protests in the city during the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. Observers said Homs was of huge strategic importance to the rebels, as its capture effectively split the Assad regime in two, severing the government in Damascus from the coast. But by Sunday morning, it was not clear there was even a functioning regime left to speak of. The rebels’ progress has been stunning. After bursting out of their territory in the northwestern Idlib province, HTS captured and in just over a week of fighting. After they were joined Friday by a in the southern Daraa province, both groups set their sights on Damascus. “We were able to liberate four Syrian cities within 24 hours: Daraa, Quneitra, Suwayda and Homs,” said Lt. Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani, a spokesperson for the main rebel group, ahead of their entry to Damascus. It had been expected that the regime would mount a firmer defense of Damascus, but the rebels said that senior Assad regime officials were preparing to defect to them in the capital. Although the official line from the Syrian president’s office is that Assad has not fled, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN that Assad is in Damascus. After regime forces quit Homs, residents began to flood the streets in celebration. Videos geolocated by CNN showed residents tearing apart posters of Assad and his father on top of the gates to the Officers’ Club in the city center. The scenes recall one of the most symbolic images from the Arab Spring in Syria in 2011, when pro-democracy protesters took to the streets and tore down Assad posters on top of the same gates. Protests in 2011 calling for Assad’s ouster sparked Syria’s deadly civil war, that has created an armed resistance to the government supported in various ways by foreign powers including neighboring Turkey, regional giants Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the United States.

He challenged Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight. He called Amazon and Blue Origin boss Jeff Bezos a “copycat.” And just recently, he sued OpenAI’s Sam Altman. Until now, these were business and personal rivalries between some of the richest and most successful people in the world. But with Musk’s new influence in the incoming Trump administration and position as “first buddy,” some fear he could use the power of the government to benefit his own companies and harm his rivals. That could come in the form of starting or dropping government investigations, creating or weakening regulations, and awarding government contracts to the benefit of Musk’s companies. “The federal government has a set of tools in its toolbox, and the question is, will the use of those tools be governed by objective standards, through regulation and laws and the normal process of government intervention in the economy, or will it be subject to the material impulses of either the president or Elon Musk?” said one expert in law and technology who asked to speak anonymously to avoid Musk’s ire. “If all it takes is for (Musk) to say, ‘Hey, DOJ should investigate them,’ that will cause a lot of headaches.” Representatives for Musk did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Bezos and Musk often compete against each other in the “richest person in the world” rankings, but they have also been rivals when it comes to the space industry. Both Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’ Blue Origins compete for federal government contracts, and now with Musk firmly tied to Donald Trump’s administration, some wonder whether he will use his influence to further entrench SpaceX’s already dominant position as a government contractor. And it’s not just government contracts with NASA for splashy rockets and trips to the International Space Station. Amazon’s also competes with SpaceX’s Starlink in the low-orbit satellite system industry. These systems require a fair amount of regulatory and launch approvals, and Amazon is working toward launching some 3,200 satellites into low Earth orbit. Jim Cantrell, an early SpaceX executive who now runs Phantom Space Corporation, said he believes the rivalry between Musk and Bezos is “much more personal than anything anybody ought to be worried about.” Instead, Cantrell said he thinks that while Musk will advocate for changes that could benefit his own companies, it will also benefit his competitors. “A rising tide lifts all boats,” Cantrell said, adding that Musk’s advocacy for commercialization of the space industry and fighting regulations that he believes slow down the industry are “going to raise the tide for all his competitors, including himself.” Cantrell said that some of these actions would end up helping the best competitor in the field — which just happens to be Musk’s companies. “I think Blue Origin should be terrified about their own performance,” Cantrell said, not terrified of Musk’s power in the Trump administration being used against them. Blue Origin, which did not respond to a request for comment, may have another reason to be worried. Trump just named who has close ties with Musk, as his pick for NASA administrator. For his part, Bezos said Wednesday at a New York Times DealBook event that he is not worried about Musk in Washington. “I take it at face value, what has been said, which is that he’s not going to use his political power to advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors,” Bezos said. Though, he added, “I could be wrong about that, but I think it could be true.” Musk’s feud with Altman’s OpenAI has been long-running. Musk — who helped to co-found OpenAI in 2015 — first the company in February, accusing the ChatGPT maker of abandoning its original, non-profit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. Musk has advocated for “open source” artificial intelligence systems and has publicly released the code behind the chatbot Grok made by his own company, xAI. Musk’s original lawsuit sought a jury trial and for OpenAI, Altman and co-founder and President Greg Brockman to pay back any profit they received from the business. OpenAI called Musk’s claims “incoherent” and “frivolous.” And Musk after OpenAI published several of Musk’s emails from OpenAI’s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. However, Musk reopened the legal battle in August, filing a new lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman with, essentially, the same claim that the start-up is undermining its non-profit mission by partnering with Microsoft and commercializing some products. OpenAI was created as a non-profit research lab with a for-profit arm, but has into a more traditional, for-profit company that could lead to more returns for investors — a plan at which Musk has also taken aim. A recent filing in his lawsuit asked a court to temporarily block OpenAI’s ability to make such a transition. Regardless of how that case ultimately plays out, Musk could potentially use his connection to Trump — as well as his friendship with David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped as White House “czar” overseeing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy — to disadvantage OpenAI. Sacks and Musk were both involved in starting PayPal. Musk could, for example, push for the government to work with and grant lucrative contracts to “open source” AI companies like his own over rivals such as OpenAI and Microsoft, said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment group D.A. Davidson. Such a move could also benefit Meta, which has open-sourced its Llama model and whose CEO, Zuckerberg, has been seeking to with Trump and said he wants an “active role” in tech policy discussions with the president-elect. “The government can decide to advantage certain companies, certain technologies and that would be within the realm of possibility,” Luria said, although he added that he ultimately believes it’s unlikely Musk will use his political influence to harm rivals. Musk could also push Congress or the Internal Revenue Service to interfere with OpenAI’s ability to transition from a non-profit to a for-profit corporation. However, Altman said Wednesday that he’s not worried about Musk’s political activities harming his company. “I believe pretty strongly … that Elon will do the right thing and it would be profoundly unamerican to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. “I don’t think people would tolerate that, I don’t think he could do that. It would go so deeply against the values that I believe he holds.” In to an X post about Altman’s comment, as well as a similar comment by Bezos, Musk said: “They are right.” A SpaceX launch once destroyed a Facebook AMOS-6 Satellite, which the company was hoping to use to beam the internet to millions of people in remote parts of the world. It’s not clear whether that’s what helped spark the long-running feud between Musk and Zuckerberg, which devolved at one point into regular insults and digs lobbed over social media. But at one point Musk and Zuckerberg were seriously discussing an Talk of a fight died down around August. And while Zuckerberg has been making inroads with Trump — meeting him at Mar-a-Lago recently and speaking openly about wanting to play an “active role” in helping the Trump administration shape tech policy — one of his top lieutenants expressed a bit more skepticism about Musk. Speaking on a BBC podcast, Meta’s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Musk is “now playing an outsized role in both the election and now the formation of the new US administration.” “He has a choice — he can be either an avid and well-heeled supporter,” Clegg said. “Or he can try and become a sort of political puppet master, going well beyond Trump, deciding who the next Republican candidate should be and the one after that, and so on, so forth.” Meta is already facing an antitrust trial, and the company could also face increased pressure from the Federal Communications Commission. Brendan Carr, Trump’s pick for FCC chair, has exchanged warm words with Musk and often engages with him on X, has been open about his desire of “smashing the censorship cartel” of social media, and Zuckerberg, as well as other big tech CEOs, that they’ve been engaging in “improper conduct.” “We can impose transparency obligations through existing FCC laws,” Carr told Fox Business last week. “If social media companies are colluding to not compete on speech regulations, that’s really no different than an agreement not to compete on pricing or another competition metric and that should be looked at.” Tesla stock surged after Trump’s win and is still riding high. While Tesla is already dominant in the electric vehicle market, it could see even greater benefits with Musk’s direct line into the government. For one, government investigations into the safety of Tesla’s autonomous driving technology could just disappear, said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Then there’s support for Tesla competitors. Last week, Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk’s co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency advisory group, a $6.6 billion Department of Energy conditional loan commitment to Rivian, the electric vehicle startup. The loan would help finance a new manufacturing plant in Georgia. Back in 2010, Tesla received a similar $465 million loan from the Energy Department that proved pivotal to its survival and success. But Ramaswamy said that loan and others like it are “high on the list of items” that DOGE will look to reverse. Musk and Ramaswamy’s DOGE effort has an expiration date in 2026, but some who know Musk wonder if his relationship with Trump will sour sooner than that. But until then, Musk said the best way for him to be lobbied is on X, his social media platform. “I will do my best to respond to well-reasoned arguments here on X for serving the best interests of the American people,” Musk on X last week. “However, any real or de facto offers of money, power or threats will obviously be silly and ineffective.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

If confirmed as secretary of state, he’s expected to take action on his parents’ homeland.", "language": "en", "datePublished": "2024-12-08T10:30:42.810Z", "dateModified": "2024-12-08T10:30:42.810000+00:00", "content": "For more than 60 years Cuba has buckled under US economic sanctions and its own government’s missteps. Life on the communist-run island could soon become even more grueling. One of the Cuban government’s most formidable adversaries, Sen. Marco Rubio under Donald Trump, something that does not bode well for the already flatlining Cuban economy. The son of Cuban exiles, Rubio has long made it his mission to ramp up the US trade embargo on Cuba. If confirmed, as is widely expected, Rubio will be perfectly situated to further tighten the screws on Cuba perhaps to the island’s breaking point. “He has reached the pinnacle of power and position in the US government that he has never held before and he is going to be putting it to Cuba to prove his reputation as an extremist hardliner on Cuba,” said Peter Kornbluh, co-author of “Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Secret Negotiations Between Washington and Havana.” “It could really be the final nail in what is already a very deep grave for Cuba,” Kornbluh told CNN. If confirmed, Secretary of State Rubio will face far more pressing issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and countering growing Chinese influence in the world, particularly in Latin America. But Cuba has been central to Rubio’s long climb from city commissioner in West Miami to state representative to US senator to Republican presidential candidate to now being selected for secretary of state. The second paragraph of Rubio’s Senate bio says he first entered government “in large part because of his grandfather who saw his homeland destroyed by communism.” The decades-old joke in Rubio’s hometown of Miami, a refuge for exiles who fled socialist regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, is that it is the only city in the United States with its own policy. That quip no longer seems so facetious as a son of exiles who fled their homeland prepares to become America’s top diplomat. As secretary of state, Rubio could run point on devising additional economic sanctions on Cuba, increasing funding for dissidents and pro-democracy programs that Havana considers tantamount to regime change, and further restricting US travel to Cuba. Under the Biden administration, the US again expanded flights to destinations across the island, and relaxed restrictions on US citizens traveling to the island. Rubio though has been a fierce critic of Americans visiting Cuba, saying in 2013, “Cuba is not a zoo where you pay an admission ticket and you go in and you get to watch people living in cages to see how they are suffering … You’ve left thousands of dollars in the hands of a government that uses that money to control these people that you feel sorry for.” Two organizers of so-called people-to-people trips that organize trips for US citizens to Cuba declined to comment to CNN about what Rubio as secretary of state could mean for their businesses, they said, because of the potential repercussions. Those who have studied his career say there is no more personal issue for Rubio than ending what he sees as a tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from US shores. “He is formed by having grown up in the town of Miami, surrounded by people who had incredibly strong feelings about Cuba, and he’s really defined himself as the son of Cuban immigrants,” Manuel Roig-Franzia, the author of “The Rise of Marco Rubio,” told CNN. “It would be shocking to me if he doesn’t find a way to raise the profile of Cuba in American foreign policy.” Rubio has done it before. During the first Trump administration, “Rubio called the shots on Cuba,” a US diplomat who did want to be quoted by name told CNN. “We were told ‘whatever he wants, he gets.’ Just keep him happy.” As secretary of state, Rubio would be able to apply pressure on the island’s communist leadership and their allies much more directly. It would be hard for a country as tied to the US as economically as, say, Mexico, which has in recent months sent Cuba hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil and paid the island to supply them with doctors, to ignore requests from a US secretary of state to cut support to Havana. And while Trump has hobnobbed with authoritarian heads of state like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, he has not shown any willingness to do so with socialist leaders in Cuba or Venezuela, which could hurt in the US. Further sanctioning the already ailing Cuban economy could backfire though. “There are no plans that I’m aware of for what to do with a failed state 90 miles off US shores,” says Ricardo Herrero, executive director of the Cuba Study Group that promotes dialogue between the two governments. “Which is what Cuba appears to be approaching or at least seems to be much closer to becoming — a failed state — than a Jeffersonian democracy.” Cuban officials, who until recently often derided the Florida senator as “Narco” Rubio, a reference to his brother-in-law’s cocaine smuggling conviction in the 1980s, have shrugged off the threat of further Trump sanctions but said they are open to negotiating directly with any US official, even Rubio. Still, Cuba’s leadership has made it clear that no amount of US pressure will force them to hold multi-party elections or release political prisoners, as US administrations going back to Eisenhower have demanded. “The results of these elections are nothing new for us,” Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel told state-run media in November following Trump’s election. “The country is ready. We will continue on, without fear, trusting that with our own effort, with our own talent, we can get ahead.” But the worsening economic reality on the ground stands in stark contrast to that bravado.

There is a slightly reduced schedule with six – the Houston Texans, Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts, New England Patriots, Washington Commanders and Baltimore Ravens – all on bye. Week 14 began on Thursday with the Detroit Lions clinching their playoff spot with their 11 consecutive win as . Here’s a look at three of Sunday’s standout matchups. Sunday’s clash at U.S. Bank Stadium sees two teams heading in different directions come head-to-head. The Atlanta Falcons have lost three straight and sit at 6-6 while the Minnesota Vikings have strung together five wins on the bounce to improve to 10-2. All eyes will be on Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins on Sunday though. The 36-year-old will be making his first appearance back in Minneapolis since leaving the Vikings in the offseason and signing a big-money contract in Atlanta. However, things haven’t gone smoothly for Cousins since moving to Georgia. Not only did the team select a quarterback in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft – Atlanta picked Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 pick – but he is currently going through one of the worst stretches of his career as he returns to face his former team. Cousins has thrown no touchdowns and six interceptions over the Falcons’ three-game losing run – four coming in the Week 13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers – with the team scoring a combined 36 points during that run. His mobility was never his strong suit but suffering a torn Achilles last season seems to have really hampered his ability to avoid pressure, leading to more turnovers. Cousins has 17 touchdown passes, 13 interceptions and 12 fumbles this season. His poor run has seen him slump to No. 31 in rankings of the 32 starting quarterbacks. As a result, the questions about whether head coach Raheem Morris might choose to bench Cousins in favor of Penix Jr. has increased in recent weeks and should the result on Sunday get out of hand, a quarterback switch could be on the cards. But Morris said on Wednesday he full expects Cousins to rebound as he returns to Minnesota and that the scrutiny he is facing is part of being in the NFL. “I know this league is built on pressure. I know pressure in this league, you better be ready to deal, and it’s all of us,” Morris told reporters. “We wouldn’t be in this business if we weren’t about pressure. I’d be a lawyer or something, not dealing with pressure. You’ve got to be ready to deal with pressure in this business. That’s what we do.” On the other side, Cousin’s replacement for the Vikings, Sam Darnold, is enjoying an excellent season with the team on course to make the playoffs. After years struggling to find his place in the league, Darnold is thriving in Minnesota. “It’s just an unbelievable place. I mean, the guys in that locker room for the most part is kind of what I meant by that and then just the people here,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “Obviously, the people in the organization, but the people that live in Minnesota have been awesome. Everywhere I go, just very genuine, very nice cordial people. I’m just really enjoying my time here.” There’s a lot potentially on the line when the Buffalo Bills take to the field at SoFi Stadium to face the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. Although the Bills have already wrapped up a playoff place with top spot in the AFC East division assured, they are still in the hunt for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, just a game behind the Kansas City Chiefs and with the tiebreak advantage. Buffalo appear to be rounding into form at the right time though, with quarterback Josh Allen making a late season push for the MVP award having strung together some outstanding performances. For the Rams, they are on the outside of the playoff picture at the moment with a 6-6 record and need to have a late season surge if they want to have any hopes of continuing their season. The return of Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua has bolstered the team’s receiving core but the Rams’ offense has been uncharacteristically stodgy under head coach Sean McVay. They have only really the 30-point mark once all season and have struggled to put teams away despite their talent on offense – conversely, the Bills have scored at least 30 points in their last six games. And McVay spoke about the challenges of facing Allen and the explosive Bills offense ahead of their Week 14 match-up. “They’re a complete offense and they have the ability to do a lot of things. I think (Allen) does a great job of getting all his playmakers involved,” McVay told reporters on Thursday. “They’re obviously doing an excellent job of being able to run the football both from the gun and underneath the center. “I think he’s playing really well within the structure when the timing and rhythm present itself. He’s getting a lot of guys involved like I mentioned. And then when things go off schedule, that’s when you see what a special player he is. He can beat you with his mind. He can beat you with his arm and he can beat you with his legs. Those are recipes for why he deserves all the accolades, the praise, and the credit that he gets.” The Rams currently have a 18% chance of reaching the playoffs, . A win on Sunday would improve those odds to 27% while a defeat would decrease them to 13%. Sunday’s action concludes with a potential preview of an AFC playoff clash. The reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday Night Football at Arrowhead Stadium. Both teams are coming off narrow victories in Week 13, with the Chiefs narrowly beating the Las Vegas Raiders on Black Friday and the Chargers needing a defensive masterclass to beat the Falcons. Neither team have been explosive on offense despite their star quarterbacks – Patrick Mahomes for Kansas City and Justin Herbert for Los Angeles – but both have excelled on defense. Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo group is one of the most feared collection of players in the league and have played a key part in the Chiefs’ successful 2024 campaign. On the other side, the Chargers have come on of late with multiple players providing key moments as the season develops. The latest to pop has been their rookie cornerback Tarheeb Still who had two interceptions, including one which he returned for a 61-yard touchdown, in the Week 13 victory over the Falcons, earning himself the AFC’s Defensive Player of the Week accolade. “I get the award, but I would say that’s a testament to how we are as a team because everybody played a part in that,” Still said. “My teammates and also the coaches doing a good job preparing me. It was a great feeling.” It could be another low-scoring affair on Sunday, with both defenses on top, in what could be a huge clash when it comes to postseason seeding. Despite struggling on offense this season, Mahomes still believes Kansas City have a chance to win their third Super Bowl title in a row. “Every team (that) I’ve been on I feel like has been a championship team. It’s been plays here or there that have - either we’ve lost in overtime in the AFC Championship game or lost in the Super Bowl,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “I feel like we have the talent, and we have the coaching staff, and we have the work ethic to go out there and win any football game. “It’s about going out there and doing that on a week-to-week, day-to-day basis. I feel like we have those guys that are motivated enough to do that, but it’s not going to be easy, and it never is. You have to really play your best football at the perfect time in order to win a championship and that’s what I’ve learned through my time in the NFL.” A win on Sunday would almost certainly guarantee the Chargers’ place in the playoffs, with NFL.com predicting a 99% chance of reaching the postseason with a victory.

The pop superstar, whose takes place Sunday night at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, emerged as a business titan after 152 concerts in 52 countries. Eras became the with an estimated windfall of $2.2 billion. In the United States, concertgoers spent spend for the Super Bowl — an average $1,300 on travel, hotels, food and merchandise, according to the US Travel Association. But the Super Bowl is just one game and has two weeks of marketing and promotion, while Swift’s tour hit 23 cities on 62 nights over the course of about five months. Swifties spent an estimated $5 billion in the United States, according to an estimate by survey company Question Pro. But that total only takes into account direct spending, according to the US Travel Association, and could exceed $10 billion when factoring in indirect spending and when non-ticket holders make purchases outside of the venue. That spending power was a part of the “Taylor Swift Effect,” which analysts deemed a “ ” Downtown areas experienced higher traffic and occupancy rates due to the influx of visitors. Swift fans often extended their stays in cities that hosted multiple shows, which further boosted local revenue. “These events have had a major revitalizing effect on local tourism industries and downtowns still struggling from the effects of the pandemic,” the California Center for Jobs & the Economy . Pittsburgh, which hosted two concerts, had its highest weekend occupancy at hotels post-pandemic and the second-highest weekend occupancy in its history. Swift’s tour raised the average daily cost of rooms to $309, and the city generated $46 million in direct spending from attendees, 83% of whom didn’t live in Allegheny County. The California Center for Jobs & the Economy estimated that Swift’s six-night concert run in Los Angeles increased local employment by 3,300 workers and local earnings by $160 million. Before the “Eras” tour hit Los Angeles, hotel jobs were about 15% below their pre-pandemic highest. The US Travel Association estimated Los Angeles County would benefit from another $320 million, with $20 million in sales and local taxes and $9 million in hotel room taxes. Eras was also a boon for ride-hailing companies. Lyft reported rides were up by an average of 8.2% in cities hosting a Swift concert and that New Orleans saw a 31% increase. The New Orleans Downtown Development District estimated between . Greater New Orleans, Inc. estimated the concerts’ economic impact to be around $200 million.

In an email to CNN on Saturday, Tyler Perry Studios said: “We are incredibly saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Steve Mensch. Steve was a cherished member of our team for more than 8 years, and well beloved in the community of Atlanta. It is hard to imagine not seeing him smiling throughout the halls. We will miss him dearly. Our heart goes out to his family as we all send them our prayers.” Mensch managed the day-to-day operations at Tyler Perry Studios, a 300-acre studio lot in Atlanta, according to his LinkedIn profile. “I was incredibly sad to learn about the tragic passing of Steve Mensch, the President and General Manager of Tyler Perry Studios,” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said in a statement. “Aside from being instrumental in establishing Atlanta as a premier destination for global film and television production, he was a trusted friend and supporter of the Mayor’s Office of Film and Entertainment.” “Whether he was hosting national conferences or allowing our interns to tour the grounds of TPS,” the mayor added, “he was always willing to share his expertise and inspire others to pursue their passion.” In 2019, of the studios, saying, “What Tyler has built here is the only major motion picture studio on the East Coast.” Mensch explained at the time how the studio he oversaw blended old with new, saying, “The history on this property is immense. Founded in 1885, we have 40 buildings on the national register, we’ve built a dozen state-of-the-art sound stages.” “We can take advantage of a hundred years of Hollywood history, of best practices and we’ve done that in incorporating the stages,” Mensch said. “Then we use the very best technology in our infrastructure, so we have the best of both.” The Florida Highway Patrol said troopers found Mensch dead at the scene of a crash just after 8 p.m. in Citrus County, Florida. The agency does not name Mensch as the man who died, though the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office said it was Mensch, 62, from Fayetteville, Georgia. “FHP Troopers responded to a single engine fixed-wing airplane crash on West White Dogwood Drive near the intersection of US-98,” the agency said in a statement. “An adult male occupant of the aircraft was pronounced deceased at the scene of the crash.” The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot was the only person on board the single-engine Vans RV12, though the agency did not mention Mensch by name. A National Transportation Safety Board investigator was expected to visit the crash site Saturday to begin documenting the scene and examining the aircraft, the NTSB told CNN in an email. A preliminary report from the agency about the crash is expected within 30 days. Perry, who as the first African American to fully own a major production studio, Mensch, “was truly a kind soul and a great leader at the studio.” “I’ve been trying to understand this tragedy all day – what went wrong with that plane,” Perry in a post on Instagram Saturday night. “Steve loved flying, and he loved that plane; he took so much pride in it.” “We all adored him and are devastated that he’s gone. I’m praying for his family as we all try to make sense of this heartbreak,” Perry added. “Georgia’s film community has suffered a huge loss,” Lee Thomas, the director of the Georgia Film Office said. “Steve’s legacy was much more than his impressive resume – he was a great friend. He had genuine warmth, a great sense of humor, and was always willing to jump in and help whenever needed.” “He will certainly be missed,” Thomas added. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp expressed his condolences on social media after Mensch’s death, praising him as “a good man” and noting his contributions to the Peach State’s film industry. “A good man and an instrumental part of a studio Georgia is proud to call its own, his achievements made our state better and brought more opportunities to its people,” Kemp on X. “His loved ones and the entire Tyler Perry Studios team will be in our thoughts and prayers as they mourn this loss.” CNN’s Lisa Respers France and Kia Fatahi and Chris Boyette contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

More than three decades later, DNA analysis has led police to the perpetrator.", "language": "en", "datePublished": "2024-12-08T13:00:44.492Z", "dateModified": "2024-12-08T14:42:02.962000+00:00", "content": "Tracy Whitney was last seen leaving a Burger King after an argument with her ex-boyfriend in August 1988. Less than 24 hours later, fishermen found her body in a river near Sumner, Washington, about 12 miles east of Tacoma. She was 18 years old. An autopsy revealed Tracy had been sexually assaulted and died of strangulation, according to a from the Pierce County Sheriff’s Office. Her death was ruled a homicide. Detectives collected DNA samples from her body that presumably belonged to the killer, interviewed people of interest and administered polygraph tests. No suspect was identified, and the case grew cold. Tracy’s sister, Robin Whitney, was 11 years old when the murder took place. Following the loss of her “protector,” Robin vowed to avoid talking about Tracy – not to her friends, her father or eventually to her daughters. “I didn’t want to think about what had happened to her, and what her last moments were like and how scared she must’ve been,” Robin told CNN. “I’d also have to think about everything we missed out on as sisters, how unfair that was.” She believed the case would likely never be solved, and thinking of all the “what ifs” only brought fresh waves of grief and frustration. But roughly 10 years ago, Robin’s father, who had avoided speaking of Tracy for decades, told her the police had recovered a DNA sample from the crime scene in 1988. The news gave Robin hope. And she slowly began sharing stories of her sister with her daughters. Robin also learned her father had visited the sheriff’s office several times since the murder, hoping to revive the investigation. In 2005, the sheriff’s office renewed efforts to solve the crime by uploading the DNA sample to the FBI’s national genetic database, CODIS. They decided to resubmit Tracy’s DNA swabs after new technology became available, the sheriff’s office said, but the effort yielded no results. The first breakthrough came in 2022, after the sheriff’s office received a grant from the state attorney general’s office. With this funding, they sent the DNA sample to Parabons NanoLab in Virginia for genetic genealogy testing. Thirty-six years after Tracy’s death, the sheriff’s office used lab data to identify John Guillot Jr. as her killer. Sheriffs, however, could not make an arrest. Guillot Jr. died eight months before authorities could connect him to the killing, Pierce County Det. Sgt. Lindsay Kirkegaard in a video released Sunday. Genetic genealogy, a combination of DNA analysis and family tree research, finally led detectives to Guillot Jr. A relatively new field of study, genetic genealogy gained prominence as history. It has since expanded into a forensic method used by law enforcement to crack cold cases. In 2018, it led to the arrest of the , and it has recently helped solve several other cold cases, including a and a . Parabon NanoLabs tested the DNA sample and traced the suspect’s family lines to the 1700s. The results pointed to Guillot Jr. as the main suspect, to the sheriff’s office. To confirm Guillot Jr. was the killer, detectives had to compare his DNA to the sample they had collected from the crime scene in 1988. That wasn’t possible because Guillot Jr.’s remains had been cremated. However, the genealogy lab findings led investigators to Guillot Jr.’s biological son, John Guillot III. The son had also recently died, but the medical examiner’s office had his DNA on file. After further genetic testing, detectives confirmed his father was a match for the suspect’s genetic profile, according to the sheriff’s office. Detectives believe Guillot Jr. and Tracy did not know each other prior to the killing. Since Guillot died before he was identified as the perpetrator, his profile could not be uploaded to CODIS to see if he was responsible for any other crimes. Robin had been waiting “almost (her) entire life” to learn the killer’s identity. But the discovery surprised Robin in other ways. “The overwhelming support that we’ve gotten from the community that we grew up in, and the general public interest and attention that she’s getting feels like justice in a way,” she said. “People are talking about her, and they remember her, and they miss her.” “On the other hand,” Robin added, “he didn’t face the criminal process, so he got away with it.” More than three decades later, Robin has the closure she has been longing for. “Since getting the news that Tracy’s case has been solved, 36 years of locked-up emotions came out all at once. I grieved her as a child, and now I’m grieving her as an adult,” Robin said. “I’m allowing myself to feel all of it, though. It’s uncomfortable and I’m sad, but it’s an emotional relief that I needed.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Gerald Radford testified on Friday that he feared for his own life when he shot John “Walt” Lay at a Tampa dog park on February 2. Local news outlets report Radford testified that Lay repeatedly hit him in the face just before the shooting. “I don’t know if I told him to stop or not, but he wasn’t stopping,” Radford testified in a hearing before Hillsborough Circuit Judge Samantha Ward. Radford is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking additional hate-crime penalties if Radford is convicted. Defense attorneys cited Florida’s in seeking immunity from prosecution. Such laws say people have no duty to retreat before using deadly force when they believe they are defending themselves against a violent crime. Prosecutors dispute Radford’s story. Several witnesses testified Friday that Radford had harassed Lay for months before the shooting, repeatedly using homophobic slurs. Prosecutors presented recorded jail phone calls where Radford used a homophobic slur to describe Lay after his arrest. Paul Gumpert, a friend of Lay, testified that it wasn’t in Lay’s character to be the aggressor, describing Lay as “very mild-mannered and very dismissive of any pressure against him.” Lay shared a video claiming Radford had threatened him at the dog park the day before the shooting. In the video, Lay claimed he had an encounter with Radford at the park and that Radford told him, “You’re going to die.” Radford acknowledged using slurs against Lay. But he told Assistant State Attorney Justin Diaz under questioning that he treated Lay differently because “of the way he treated me” and not because of his sexual orientation. Defense attorneys pointed to a text message Lay sent after the video as proof he planned to attack Radford. Lay wrote in part that he would “try to tackle” Radford if he blocked his path again. In addition, he wrote, “this weekend should be drama.” In response to questions from defense attorney Matthew Futch, the 66-year-old Radford said the 52-year-old Lay had “completely” overpowered him. “Had you not drawn your firearm to defend yourself, do you believe you would have suffered great bodily harm or death?” Futch asked. Radford, crying, answered yes. But prosecutors said the trajectory of the bullet through Lay’s body, as traced by an autopsy, makes it unlikely that Lay was on top of Radford when Lay was shot, as Radford claims. Hillsborough County Chief Medical Examiner Kelly Devers testified it would be “hard” for a bullet to take the path it did if Lay had been laying or kneeling on Radford. Diaz argued there are inconsistencies in Radford’s account. “It’s a hate crime,” Diaz said. Ward said she will rule on the stand-your-ground motion next week. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Tucker tells CNN Travel, “I think it’s important to always take a step back here and really think about, ‘Well, what countries can I actually move to as an American?’ The harder issue is, if you really want to make that permanent relocation, then you really need to think about, ‘What visa types can I actually get?’ ” According to Google Trends, searches related to phrases such as and “how to move to Canada” skyrocketed in November 2024, following the news that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. It’s been even more than the exponential rise in similar searches after he won the 2016 election. (Back then, .) Whether or not a move abroad is politically motivated, the increase of remote work, new visa programs and tax incentives that attract digital nomads, investors, retirees and families have as of late provided additional options for people considering an international move. Of course, the ability to move abroad is a privilege that extends only to people lucky enough to be in possession of the right passport, with doors remaining closed to many nationalities. Recently, headlines have swirled around the news of several US celebrities moving out of the United States, including Richard Gere, who has publicly discussed his upcoming move to Spain, where his wife is from, and Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, who have reportedly . For those who have the option, choosing which country to make your new home is a major decision that requires extensive research and planning. Beyond the “I could live here!” daydreaming that might bubble up during vacation, moving abroad means a deep dive into tax implications, work visas, health care and quality-of-life comparisons, just to name a few. One helpful resource is the annual by InterNations, an expat community with more than 5.4 million members. The survey, which has been running for more than a decade, reflects input from more than 12,500 expats representing 175 nationalities in 174 countries or territories. It conveys their satisfaction level with various aspects of expat life on the basis of factors such as quality of life, ease of settling in, working abroad, personal finance, housing and language. In addition, retirees can take advantage of resources including , whose annual index ranks its top 10 overseas retirement destinations. Its 2024 index saw Valencia, Spain, top the list, followed by Braga, Portugal, and Mazatlán, Mexico. It’s also important to consider the impact of your move on a new host country, especially in destinations that are seeing big upticks in immigration from the United States and other wealthy nations, says , a relocation consultant and writer who has lived in Mexico City for the past nine years. Frye advises clients considering a move from the United States to Mexico — which has ranked among the top five countries in InterNations’ annual survey since 2014 — to be aware of the inequities in migration policies between the two countries. “My focus with my clients is to be very clear about the gentrification problem that Mexico faces, and to give them an opportunity to think about what our role is in that situation,” says Frye, who is originally from Michigan. “I believe all people should be able to move freely wherever they want, but there’s a clear injustice considering how easy it is for US citizens to relocate to Mexico in comparison with the other way around.” While there are dozens of destinations to consider for a move abroad, the following list prioritizes a range of expat-centric topics, including quality of life, affordability, health care, safety and access to culture and outdoor activities. This list offers general advice for people making the move from anywhere in the world, but focuses primarily on US citizens. Also included are some of the downsides to consider, as well as key info on how to make the move. A popular retirement destination for Americans for decades, Mexico has attracted many more families and the digital nomad set over the past few years. Mexico City — whose population of 22 million in the metro area makes it North America’s biggest city — has been especially hot as of late. And the capital’s growth shows no signs of slowing, with about 667,300 more inhabitants projected in 2025 than three years prior, according to . From , the number of Americans who applied for or renewed residency visas spiked from about 17,800 to more than 30,000. Elsewhere, cities including Oaxaca, San Miguel de Allende and Playa del Carmen are also havens for US expats, many of whom point to Mexico’s lower cost of living and relaxed lifestyle as strong draws. Mexico topped InterNations’ 2023 Expat Insider survey and has ranked among the top five countries since 2014. According to the latest results, expats appreciate factors such as the ease of settling in, a fulfilling social life and strong support networks. Mexico’s affordability and laid-back lifestyle also score high. As with other global destinations that have received an influx of Americans as of late, some Mexican cities with large expat communities are getting pushback against foreigners. Mexico also has a high crime rate. Homicide rates are nearly four times as those in the United States, according to . And those numbers may be even higher: Data from the Human Rights Watch suggests that an estimated 90% of crimes in Mexico are never reported. Moving to Mexico isn’t as simple as packing a bag, hopping a flight and toasting to your new life south of the border over a margarita on the beach. Traditionally, valid passport holders from countries that don’t require a visa (including the United States) who are coming to Mexico for leisure or business have been allowed to remain in the country for up to 180 days. (They still must complete a visitor’s permit, or , FMM for short, at their port of entry.) However, that 180-day limit is no longer the default, and the exact number of days allowed is at the discretion of the immigration official processing entry. Mexico does not offer a digital nomad visa, but those considering a permanent move can look into a , which allows you to remain in the country for up to four years. Meanwhile, retirees can apply for a . A gorgeous climate, a relatively low cost of living, and vibrant, culture-rich cities and towns from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: No wonder more Americans are eagerly proclaiming for their next life chapter. Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Bilbao all boast large English-speaking expat communities, while the coastal city of Valencia is quickly gaining traction as a coveted spot, too: It ranked first in InterNations’ 2024 , and also topped the annual index by . There’s to love about Spain: modern cities and quaint small towns, high-quality universal health care and a world-renowned dining and nightlife scene, just to name a few benefits. In fact, the Spanish cities of Valencia, Málaga and Alicante ranked in the top three of InterNations’ most recent list of . According to the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, Spain also is and welcoming countries for LGBTQ+ travelers. In 2005, it became one of the first to legalize same-sex marriage, and it hosts one of the world’s largest Pride celebrations, which draws some 1.5 million visitors every year. If you’re hoping moving to Spain will boost your career, you may need to adjust your expectations. According to InterNations’ 2023 survey, “Spain performs worst in the Working Abroad Index (34th). Less than half the expats (49%) agree that moving there has improved their career prospects (vs. 59% globally),” and another 36% are unhappy with the local job market. In addition, English is generally not widely spoken outside of larger cities. And, in the regions of Catalonia and the Basque Country, the official languages are Catalan and Euskara (or Basque), respectively. The distinctly Spanish way of life also is an adjustment for many, as schedules for working, dining and socializing are later than American standards. The workday generally runs from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with a long lunch break during the afternoon (during which time many businesses are closed), and Spaniards usually eat dinner no earlier than around 8:30 p.m. Politics in Spain is also becoming increasingly more divisive (and ), especially as the northeastern region of Catalonia continues its push for independence. Several options exist for expats, including retirees, looking to relocate to Spain. Anyone with sufficient funds to support themselves and any dependents can consider the , which is ideal for retirees and those who have other forms of passive income that originates in the United States. (However, you can’t earn income while in Spain with this visa. Spain also offers a and an And in November 2024, the Spanish government announced , including extending its “job-seeking visa” from three months to a full year. However, recent changes have also made obtaining a digital nomad visa more complicated. Now, applicants must provide additional documentation around their business, such as proof of its existence at least a year prior and proof of ongoing contracts. This bicycling-obsessed nation ranked sixth in Gallup’s , which assesses various indicators across life satisfaction and social and economic well-being. It also topped Numbeo’s 2023 survey for quality of life. As of 2022, almost 31,000 immigrants from the Americas lived in the Netherlands, . The capital of Amsterdam is especially popular, with its picturesque canals, historic architecture and relaxed vibe drawing a large international crowd, but robust expat communities also exist in larger cities such as Rotterdam and Utrecht. For active types, it’s hard to beat the Netherlands’ world-class cycling infrastructure and culture – in fact, the country is said to have more bikes ( ) than people. The Netherlands also is known for its strong education system, with most education at all levels funded at least in part by the government. The Netherlands is also increasingly popular among the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, it tops a data-driven list for LGBTQ+ individuals compiled by international insurance provider William Russell, based on various factors such as safety and inclusiveness One major tax advantage for foreigners: Highly skilled workers can apply for what’s known as the , a tax advantage in which they’re granted a tax-free 30% allowance of their gross salary for five years. However, in January 2024, the a cap on the amount of wages eligible for the ruling. Compared with some other European countries, the Netherlands is pricey: Rents for unfurnished apartments hit an all-time high in November 2023, according to . Outside main hubs, smaller cities and towns including Haarlem, Delft, Leiden and Maastricht are less expensive. In addition, income taxes are high, with a tax rate of 49.5% on salaries exceeding €73,031 (roughly $81,135). That can come as quite a shock following five years of enjoying the 30% rule — which leads many expats to start considering their next move after their eligibility ends. Finally, the weather — gray, chilly and rainy in winter and early spring (which makes biking a lot less enjoyable) and constantly windy (there’s a reason for all those windmills) — can be difficult for some people to handle. The Netherlands does not offer a digital nomad visa, but you can , also known as an authorization for temporary stay (in Dutch, it’s MVV for short). Self-employed individuals, meanwhile, can apply for a visa under the (also known as DAFT). In the United States, you can apply at the Netherlands embassy in Washington or at the consulates-general in Miami, New York or San Francisco. Germany is the European Union’s biggest economy, and its strong job market and robust welfare system — not to mention heritage-rich cities and towns — are appealing for , especially Americans. According to the , more than 122,000 Americans call Germany home. Berlin has an especially large international community of English-speaking internationals, but other hubs such as Munich, Frankfurt and Stuttgart also have strong expat communities. Germany is a great fit for families, thanks to universal health care and social benefits such as a monthly (“children money”) stipend, heavily subsidized childcare and generous parental leave. In addition, compared with some other European countries, Germany’s freelancer visa is fairly easy to obtain, Tucker tells CNN Travel. She also notes that “one benefit that US citizens have over some non-EU countries is that they can apply for a Freelance Visa in Germany, as US citizens do not need an entry visa.” Germany doesn’t have some of the same conveniences to which many Americans are accustomed, such as 24-hour grocery stores or drive-through pharmacies. On Sundays, most stores are closed (with the general exception of restaurants and bakeries). And the country’s bureaucracy can be maddening, with many government processes relying on official paperwork that’s delivered through the mail. In addition, Germany’s growing popularity among has contributed to a housing pinch in major cities, especially Berlin, where finding accommodation is one of the most stressful aspects of a move. And beyond major cities, English is not widely spoken. Germany’s allows certain individuals with a qualifying degree or certificate a six-month window to search for employment in their area of qualification. Its is also fairly straightforward. Costa Rica’s abundant natural beauty, warm climate and affordable cost of living have for decades appealed to expats looking to immerse themselves in which translates to “pure life” and is both the national slogan and lifestyle. The Central American country has long been a popular destination for Americans. Costa Rica’s excellent health-care system consistently ranks high. It’s also one of the most sustainable countries in the world, and many locals lead outdoorsy lifestyles, whether that’s surfing year-round or doing daily yoga postures on the beach. In addition, Costa Rica offers some tax incentives that appeal to foreign nationals. “Costa Rica only taxes income earned in the country, which means that non-Costa Rican pensions, investments or employment income do not incur an additional Costa Rican tax burden,” David Lesperance, founder and principal of , a tax and immigration advisement firm, tells CNN Travel. Costa Rica’s laid-back lifestyle also can affect how business is done. For some newcomers, adopting to that slower-paced culture, which spans a concept known as “Tico Time,” referring to the tendency to show up late, can be difficult. In addition, some creature comforts may be lacking compared with what Americans are used to. In older buildings, for example, it’s not uncommon to throw instead of flushing it down the toilet. And thanks to its geography and location along the infamous Ring of Fire, Costa Rica experiences earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic activity — it’s home to six active volcanoes. One important note on the tax front: There is no tax treaty between Costa Rica and the United States, so claims on US tax returns for foreign tax credits or foreign earned income are more complicated for expats. With the country’s , which was implemented in 2022, remote workers can stay in Costa Rica for up to a year with an option to extend for another year. Often described as the Miami of Central America, Panama City is a prominent financial and business hub linking North America and South America. In recent years, the country of Panama has been drawing more Americans beyond just the retirement set. Lesperance says he’s seen a notable bump in moves among clients with high net worths with Hispanic heritage, as well as workers in the financial sector moving there “en masse,” especially as Miami has become more crowded and expensive. Year-round warm weather, a mix of relaxed beach towns and cosmopolitan hubs such as Panama City, and easy access to North America and South America make Panama an excellent option for frequent travelers. And one of the biggest advantages for Panama’s Golden Visa scheme is that it provides perpetual residency without requiring investors to reside there. Maintaining permanent resident status requires a visit to Panama at least every two years. In 2023, Panama announced the cost of establishing residence would increase from $300,000 to $500,000. However, following a drop in applications, the country reversed that decision in October 2024, Lesperance said. “The minimum investment is $300,000 which must be held for at least five years,” he explains. “Investors can qualify via real estate purchases, bank deposits or investing in funds” – even so, that’s a high barrier to entry for many people. In addition, as with Costa Rica, Panama also does not have a tax treaty with the United States. That makes claims on US tax returns for foreign tax credits or foreign earned income especially complicated, Lesperance notes. Panama offers several types of investment opportunities that offer permanent residency and a path to Panamanian citizenship after five years. The (or PQII) program, often known as the Panama Golden Visa, is a residency-by-investment procedure. The minimum investment remains at $300,000, which must be held for at least five years. Investors can qualify via real estate purchases, bank deposits or investing in funds. Panama also has a . However, Lesperance notes that although the retirement route technically comes with Panamanian citizenship after five years, “in practice it is not straightforward. Therefore advantages of the PQII pathway versus the cost of a retirement visa are questionable.” It’s hard to imagine a country that boasts a more universally romantic notion of living abroad, and thanks in part to the popularity of investment schemes such as the one euro homes that some small towns have launched, expats now have more options of fulfilling their dreams of . Access to some of the world’s most popular tourist cities, picturesque countryside and immersion in a culture that values family, food and wine — what’s not to love about Italian life? Italy’s health-care system is also good, and many expats give a big thumbs-up to the overall friendliness of Italians. Prospects for employment in Italy aren’t as abundant as in other European countries. Beyond major cities, English generally isn’t widely spoken, and you’ll likely need to hire an attorney to help navigate legal processes such as purchasing a home. And be prepared for Italy’s infamously glacial government bureaucracy. Americans planning to stay more than three months must get an before arriving in the country.

In addition, some Americans opt to try to obtain — or “right to blood” — via descent or ancestry, though the process can be complex and lengthy and require the assistance of a lawyer. While the reality of living in France is drastically different from what’s portrayed in the highly styled scenes of “Emily in Paris,” there’s still plenty to say to: universal health care, highly valued work-life balance (remember all those protests in response to the French government raising the retirement age?) and some of the world’s most coveted food and fashion scenes. The country also scores well on InterNations’ indexes for quality of life. Residents can take advantage of numerous social benefits, including universal health care, economic stability and numerous public holidays — not to mention a 35-hour work week. In addition to the excellent quality of life, from a tax standpoint “because they have some good treaties with the US,” Tucker says. “For example, they are one of the few countries where Roth IRAs are considered qualified retirement accounts and their tax-free nature is preserved. So even though the tax rates are higher, if you can do some pre-immigration planning, it can still be an attractive country for US expats.” As Tucker notes, income and social taxes in France are high: up to 45% (and high-income individuals also may need to pay a surcharge of 3% on part of their income). Outside of major cities such as Paris, Lyon and Strasbourg, the language barrier can be problematic if you don’t have a solid grasp of French. Plenty of foreign nationals are singing Singapore’s praises: In 2022, this sophisticated city-state ranked third on InterNations’ . It’s viewed as one of the top countries in which to live and work, thanks to a thriving job market, excellent education and health care, and one of the world’s best transportation systems. Singapore is a top financial and investment hub in Asia, with excellent job prospects and economic stability. Foodies, meanwhile, will love its dazzling dining scene, from lively night markets to Michelin-starred restaurants. And travel enthusiasts can take advantage of easy access to one of the world’s most awarded aviation hubs, Changi Airport. Singapore is very expensive, and some people may have trouble adjusting to its humid, tropical climate. It’s also a long way away from the United States, which can be tricky for visits to see loved ones. Singapore doesn’t offer a digital nomad visa, but those who have work lined up for an Employment Pass. Entrepreneurs interested in starting a business in Singapore can apply for an , which has no minimum salary requirement. Portugal’s popularity among expats has exploded since the country introduced its Golden Visa program in 2012. It has become the most successful of its kind, inspiring other countries to launch their own plans to attract foreign investment. However, in the spring of 2023, to the program, effectively ending the real estate investment aspect. It also changed its non-habitual resident regime, says Alex Ingrim, president and co-founder of , which specializes in wealth management and tax strategies for US expats. “Portugal’s a little bit harder of a place to immigrate to [now] if you want the flexibility of a Golden Visa,” Ingrim tells CNN Travel. “It’s not as attractive from a tax jurisdiction standpoint. And we’ve seen a lot of people kind of lose interest in Portugal frankly, and start planning for other jurisdictions in Europe.” Portugal is tough to beat for its affordability, quality of life, year-round mild weather and high-quality health-care system. The cost of living is generally more affordable than most countries in Europe (though that’s changing as of late, especially in popular cities such as Lisbon and Porto) and according to Numbeo, the world’s largest crowd-sourced quality of life database, it’s 35.5% lower than in the United States. In addition, Portugal is the in the world. As is the case in Mexico and other countries with large expat communities, there’s growing backlash against the influx of foreigners, especially Americans, and especially in Lisbon. Critics say the resulting has forced out longtime residents and changed the fabric of certain neighborhoods. The Golden Visa program is still in place, although the country has now eliminated the real estate investment option. As Ingrim notes, Americans still interested in pursuing residency via that route “need to be really cognizant of how it affects their financial planning, how it affects their US tax obligations and whether it’s still the best option for them moving forward.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

The city council passed an ordinance last month banning the release of Mylar balloons and all those coated in metal or other “conductive material.” It doesn’t prohibit buying the balloons. Over the summer, a wayward cluster of metallic balloons triggered a outage in Orleans Parish after coming into contact with a power line. The brief outage caused the city’s water pumps to be “tripped offline,” , leading to a disruption of the city’s water treatment plant and even causing serious injury to a Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans employee. “For almost a 24-hour period, the world thought our water supply could be knocked out by a Mylar balloon,” Council Member JP Morell said at . A vocal public safety advocate, Council Member Joseph Giarrusso began pushing this summer for the ban on metallic balloon releases in New Orleans to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. “We simply cannot afford to have power outages and hurt ourselves unnecessarily,” Giarrusso told city council in a meeting last month. “And unfortunately, Mylar balloons, those foil balloons, conduct electricity, they cause power outages and they make things unsafe for residents and harder for us to live here.” Giarrusso’s concerns extend beyond the incident in August, he told CNN; he was motivated by a series of similar events throughout the state and across the nation, all stemming from the mishandling of electrically conductive party decorations. “I actually spoke to a former state senator who told me that in another part of the state, somebody had fired a (metallic) confetti cannon at a power line and the electricity arced back to the float and almost caught the float on fire,” he said. In February 2023, officials said, a confetti cannon may have played a role in a brief power failure during a Carnival celebration in New Orleans. posted on social media shows the power going out at the parade moments after a confetti cannon was fired from a float. The city council passed an ordinance in July that included a ban on confetti cannons and confetti at parades. Desiree Ontiveros, founder of New Orleans based , said she supports the ban on metallic balloons but argues city efforts should focus on upgrading outdated infrastructure instead. “There’s just better ways for City Council to be spending their time than banning balloons,” she said, calling for investments that would more effectively tackle the root of the problem. “Yes, balloons shouldn’t be released — it’s littering, at the end of the day,” Ontiveros said, pointing out her company has long discouraged releases, even including a policy against releases on its website. Badass Balloon Co. specializes in biodegradable latex balloons and air-filled installations designed for creative displays rather than soaring into the sky. It’s not only a problem in New Orleans. While balloon releases can be a symbolic act for people either celebrating or mourning, they also pose significant environmental risks. In places like the University of Nebraska, the practice has become commonplace during the school’s homecoming game when students, upholding a into the sky. But even Cornhuskers with their long-standing tradition are facing a balloon ban of their own. The Association of Students for the University of Nebraska passed a bill last month opposing the release of “red balloons at home football games after Nebraska’s first touchdown,” according to the . “Even though that they do use biodegradable balloons, those take around seven years to decompose and the strings aren’t biodegradable themselves,” Luke McDermott, the association’s external vice president, told . “Not only is there impacts with it being on the ground and people can see it, but also, like, animals can eat it. They can kill animals.” Improperly disposed-of balloons can also end up in the ocean and along shorelines, becoming part of marine debris, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s .

In the wide-ranging interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker, Trump reiterated his campaign pledge to launch mass deportations of people who immigrated to the US illegally and end birthright citizenship, but he also suggested he’s willing to work with Democrats to craft a plan to protect thousands of immigrants who were brought to the US as children — marking his clearest comments yet on the subject. “We have to do something about the Dreamers, because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age, and many of these are middle-aged people now. They don’t even speak the language of their country. And yes, we’re going to do something about that,” Trump said in his “Meet the Press” interview, which was taped on Friday and aired in full on Sunday. “I will work with the Democrats on a plan, and if we can come up with a plan — but the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the Dreamers,” he added. Trump had previously expressed some support for protecting Dreamers during his first term in office, although his administration tried to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects them from deportation. That attempt was by the Supreme Court in 2020. Trump said his administration’s mass deportation efforts will target people with criminal histories, but indicated it could go beyond deporting criminals — without specifying who the “other people outside of criminals” would be. When asked if he plans to deport every person who has entered the country illegally, he said, “I think you have to do it.” “It’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,” he said. Asked about families with mixed immigration status — where parents are in the country illegally, but their children are not — Trump said, “I don’t want to be breaking up families,” saying the way around that was to deport the whole family together. “I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together, and you have to send them all back,” he said. Trump also doubled down on his campaign promise to end birthright citizenship, a right protected by the 14th Amendment, and suggested he may attempt to overturn birthright citizenship through executive action. “We’re gonna have to get it changed, or maybe I would go back to the people, but we have to end it. We’re the only country that has it,” he said, explaining that he had wanted to do that during his first term. “If we can, through executive action. I was going to do it through executive action, but then we had to fix Covid first, to be honest with you. We have to end it.” Trump said he would not seek “retribution” against President Joe Biden and against his political enemies, but he repeatedly left room for his appointees to decide whether to go after specific people. He suggested members of Congress who led the investigations into his conduct during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, should be put in jail and that he’ll look on his first day at issuing pardons to supporters involved that day. “These people have been there, how long is it? Three or four years? You know, by the way, they’ve been in there for years, and they’re in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn’t even be allowed to be open,” he said. Nearly 1,200 people either have pleaded guilty or were found guilty at trial for crimes connected to the January 6 attack, to the Justice Department. More than 645 defendants were ordered to serve some jail time. Trump said he would not direct his Justice Department to investigate members of Congress and Biden administration officials who led the investigations into his role in January 6, but continued to suggest his DOJ would be justified in deciding to launch investigations without his input. When asked about the possibility of investigating special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the two since-dropped federal cases against him, Trump said he wants his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, to “do what she wants to do.” “She’s very experienced. I want her to do what she wants to do. I’m not going to instruct her to do it,” he said. Trump was more direct when speaking about the members of Congress who led the House Select Committee on the January 6, telling Welker that the the co-chairs of the committee — Republican Liz Cheney, who has since left Congress, and Democrat Bennie Thompson — should “go to jail.” “Cheney was behind it. So is Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee,” he said. “For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail,” he said. CNN has reached out to Cheney and Thompson for comment. Pressed whether he’d direct Bondi or Kash Patel, his pick to replace the current FBI director, to send them to jail, Trump said, “No, not at all,” before adding, “I think they’ll have to look at that.” “But I’m not going to — I’m going to focus on drill, baby, drill,” he added. Asked if he plans to follow up on his frequent campaign promise to investigate Biden — whom he repeatedly labeled as “corrupt” and a “criminal” on the campaign trail — Trump said he doesn’t want to “go back into the past.” “I’m really looking to make our country successful. I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said. “I’m looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success.” When asked about previously saying he would direct his Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden, Trump said he would not do that but left the door open for top DOJ officials to make their own determinations. “No, I’m not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable,” he said. “But that’s not going to be my decision. That’s going to be Pam Bondi’s decision, and, to a different extent, Kash Patel, assuming they’re both there, and I think they’re both going to get approved.” Trump has tapped Patel to lead the FBI, despite the current director, Trump appointee Christopher Wray, still having several years left in his 10-year term. Throughout the interview, Trump at times struck a more temperate tone toward his political opponents and appeared to prioritize uniting the country over exacting vengeance. He said he plans to make unity a central theme of his inauguration address, and expressed confidence that his administration will achieve a level of success that will bring the country together. But Trump invoked similar calls for unity at various points throughout his campaign — including in the wake of the first assassination attempt against him — before often reverting to bitter, divisive rhetoric and personal attacks. © 2024 Cable News Network.

Trump reiterated his intention to try to end birthright citizenship, in which, under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, someone born in the US is granted automatic citizenship even if their parents are not citizens. And he asserted, “We’re the only country that has it.” This is not true; CNN and previously debunked the claim when Trump made it during his presidential campaign in 2015 and . provide automatic citizenship to people born on their soil, including US neighbors Canada and Mexico and the majority of South American countries. Here are some other false and misleading claims Trump made in the portion of the interview that NBC aired on television on Sunday morning. (CNN has not yet reviewed the additional chunks of the interview that NBC released online.) : Trump falsely claimed, “Crime is at an all-time high.” That is nowhere close to true. Both violent crime and property crime rates and are far below all-time highs. FBI data shows that crime . : Trump falsely claimed of the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency: “They cost Americans nothing.” after , including , that Americans bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. The tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters as Trump regularly claims, and it’s easy to find of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers. : Trump falsely claimed that, during his presidency, “We had no inflation.” In fact, cumulative inflation during Trump’s presidency . Trump falsely claimed that inflation was so low during his presidency that the Biden administration “didn’t have inflation for a year and a half – they went almost two years, just based on what I had created.” In reality, there was over Joe Biden’s ; the Biden-era peak for month-over-month inflation, 9.1%, , during those first two years. : Trump vaguely reiterated his lie that he was the real winner of the 2020 election, saying, “I think it’s an easy argument, it was really proven even more conclusively by the win that I had on this one.” His legitimate victory in the 2024 election does not do anything to validate his claims that the 2020 election was stolen, : Trump repeated his frequent false claim there were “13,099 murderers released into our country over the last three years.” In reality, as , that official figure is about immigrants with homicide convictions in the US today who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s own administration, not over the past three years or solely under the Biden administration.

Trump has never corroborated this claim, and experts have told , and that they haven’t seen any evidence that it is true. : Trump repeated a false claim he has repeatedly made about European countries and trade: “They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our food product, they don’t take anything.” None of this is true. The US in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), US federal figures show. According to a December 2023 from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports — importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles .) And the US government the EU was the fifth-largest 2022 export market for US agricultural and related products, behind China, Canada, Mexico and Japan. : Trump claimed, “I am the one that saved Obamacare.” This is misleading at best. As president, Trump tried to repeal Obamacare but failed because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. After that, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the law, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges – and they several central provisions of the law in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, instead arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated.

Then the holiday season rolls in, with a slew of performances, parties, gift obligations, and questions about which family members they’ll visit this year and whether to let the kids use screens during winter break. “How many events can I even physically show up to when you have work and other responsibilities?” asked Huggins, an editorial consultant in West Windsor, New Jersey. “And is it going to scar my child if I go to the two chorus things and not the holiday pageant or the holiday party? And then am I going to scar my child if I give them too few gifts or not enough gifts?” There’s also the consideration of gifts or cards for classroom teachers, music and art instructors, lunch aides and case managers. When it comes to gifts, people often don’t see “the mental aspect,” Huggins said. “I want to show them that I appreciate them. You don’t want to give them junk. Then there’s the shipping deadlines, making sure that it’s in your budget.” Like Huggins, many parents are up against the “ way before the holiday season adds extra demands. What should parents do when even more is piled on for the holidays? Experts say parents can try to make the season more manageable by rethinking expectations, asking for help, handling family drama strategically and giving themselves something to look forward to in January. To start, how do you want to feel during this holiday season? That’s an important question parents can consider, said Anna Seewald, a Princeton, New Jersey-based psychologist and host of the “Authentic Parenting” podcast. “It could be cozy and warm,” Seewald said. “So everything you do during the holiday season — the shopping, the cooking, the getting together — you can always pause and ask yourself this question: Is this making me feel cozy and warm? Is this aligned with my intention?” The answer, she noted, can help you say yes or no to an invitation. Parents can also consider the source of their expectations, said Kimberly Solo, a Medfield, Massachusetts-based therapist who treats adult women. Parents may feel pressure to get matching family pajamas because they see others doing it on social media. But doing so may be too expensive or even just annoying. Instead, she suggested parents ask: “What’s our bandwidth? How much do we have to give this holiday season?” Seewald also recommended parents reconsider past traditions to see if they still suit you. “Give yourself permission to do it differently, because you are in a different place today,” she said. “Just because for the past 10 years you’ve done it that way doesn’t mean you have to continue at the cost of your mental health or sanity.” Women are often the “default parents” who take on most of the planning and organizing in their families, Solo noted. When workloads increase dramatically around the holidays, it’s especially important to delegate or ask the family to pitch in and split up the duties. To cut down on cooking responsibilities, Seewald suggested catering dishes or asking everyone to bring something. “It doesn’t have to be all homemade, all from scratch,” she said, “maybe not this year, if you have a toddler and a sick child, and some other things going on in your life.” For some families, the presents just pile up, but Seewald said it is possible to cut down on the number of gifts without being a grinch. She suggested parents ask for donations to a charity — which they could select with their kids. Or, if a large family is getting together, each family member could pick one kid to buy for and invest in a meaningful gift. Another option is enlisting kids to choose some of their presents to donate in January. It will feel good to reduce household clutter and give to others. If your finances are tight during the holidays, the pressure can be hard. “ can help, and it’s OK to ask for basic needs. (And remind yourself that children will remember the hot chocolate and movie nights more than the latest electronic gadgets they did not get when they’re older.) Many people have colorful characters in their families whom they get together with during the holidays. Solo said it’s important to have reasonable expectations and not assume relatives will change. A get-together doesn’t feel cozy or warm if certain kids tend to bully their younger cousins. So don’t go or plan to stay for a short time and have an exit plan. And leave if you don’t like the mood. Solo also recommended parents practice self-care before those events — such as getting enough rest and visiting with supportive friends — so they’re better equipped to manage the stress. After the holidays are over, a phone-free family night — playing a game or watching a movie — is a great way to bring people together without creating extra work for anyone. Solo also tells her clients to make plans to do something for themselves in January. If a trip is outside of their budget, she said, maybe a friend can take their kids one night, and another night they can take care of the friend’s children. “Plan something for January to look forward to that doesn’t involve taking care of other people,” she said. That’s another way parents can make a frenetic season feel a little more calm and bright. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The New York Police Department is working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies across the country to search for the suspect, with the public being encouraged with rewards. Two new photos released by police show the suspect masked with a hood in the backseat of a vehicle and wearing a jacket walking on the street. While authorities say they believe the suspect has long left New York City after fatally shooting on Wednesday, officials said they feel confident he will be captured. “Let him continue to believe he can hide behind a mask,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said of the suspect. “We’re going to reveal who he is, and we’re going to bring him to justice.” Here’s what authorities are still trying to find: And here are some of the key pieces of evidence they’ve gathered: But crucially, there was no gun in the backpack. Police divers are continuing their search for the weapon in a lake in Central Park on Sunday after searching the park’s iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain on Saturday, a law enforcement official told CNN. The divers are operating in the same area on Sunday, according to footage from CNN affiliate WABC. After recovering the Peak Design backpack from Central Park on Friday, police examined it at a forensic lab in Queens. Inside, they found Monopoly money, a law enforcement source told CNN. It also contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, and it was not immediately clear if other items were in the backpack, officials said. There has still been no sign of the bicycle. Meanwhile, photos of the suspect have been circulated to multiple law enforcement agencies, including airports and border patrol stations along the Mexican and Canadian borders in the hope he won’t slip out of the country. The FBI is offering of reward money for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The NYPD has added . The search for the suspect and more physical evidence come after Thompson, 50, was shot on a busy Manhattan street early on December 4 as he approached the New York Hilton Midtown on West 54th Street to attend his company’s annual investor conference while the killer waited for him, according to New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The shooter then from the Hilton and fled northbound through an alley between 54th Street and 55th Street. He rode off on an electric bike on 55th, investigators told CNN. From there, the suspect headed north on Sixth Avenue toward Central Park. Police say the man was spotted near the George Washington Bridge and George Washington Port Authority bus terminal at 178th Street around 45 minutes after the shooting. The killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO has rattled other health care companies concerned about their own leadership’s safety and prompted some of them to ramp up security and from their websites. The backpack, photos, surveillance videos, ammunition left behind, and DNA evidence have thus far helped investigators get closer to zeroing in on the suspect despite hitting dead ends with the use of software and an unusable fingerprint previously obtained by police, according to Joseph Kenny, the NYPD’s chief detective. Investigators continue to search for the electric bike the suspect rode the day of the shooting and are examining whether the shooter used a larger firearm used on farms and ranches to put down animals without causing a loud noise, Kenny said Friday. The 9 mm shell casings undergoing testing had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written across them, with one word on each of the three bullets, Kenny told reporters. Police are looking into whether the words, similar in phrasing to a common description of insurance company tactics – “Delay, deny, defend” – may point to a motive. “That might be him sending a message saying why it was that he shot (Thompson), but at the same time, it could be a diversion to try to get taken away from the real reason behind it,” former FBI Special Agent Kenneth Gray told CNN on Saturday. “Until he’s caught, we won’t actually know the purpose of those words,” Gray said. Authorities are seeking the public’s help identifying Thompson’s killer through surveillance images showing the unmasked suspect in an Upper West Side hostel where he checked in using a fake New Jersey driver’s license. But with some portraying the killer as a vigilante enacting justice against a health care system , and with other users on social media mocking the CEO’s death, it could hinder motivation to report sightings of the killer to police. Police are tracking down as many tips as they can, as the manhunt spreads and authorities try to determine where the suspect might surface. NYPD officials said they believe the suspect left New York City on an interstate bus, the same mode of transportation investigators believe he used to get to the city days earlier: He traveled to New York on a starting its route in Atlanta, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN. Those sources added authorities do not know whether the suspect boarded in Atlanta or elsewhere. The Atlanta Police Department announced Friday, without elaborating, it will assist the investigation after the NYPD contacted it. NYPD detectives arrived in Atlanta on Saturday as part of the probe, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told CNN. In the meantime, the gun remains the key piece of outstanding evidence police are searching for, building a case against the shooter for when he’s found.

But in a sign of the potential danger Israel feels from unknown rulers in Damascus, Netanyahu ordered the military to seize the buffer zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. “Together with the Defense Minister, and with full backing from the Cabinet, I directed the IDF yesterday to take control of the buffer zone and the dominant positions near it,” he said while visiting the Golan Heights. “We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.” It is the first time Israeli troops would be stationed in the buffer zone since a 1974 agreement establishing the line of control between Israel and Syria, though they have in the past entered the area for brief periods. The buffer zone, a demilitarized area within Syria and administered by its government, and was patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. Israeli leaders are watching events across the border in Syria with a mix of trepidation and glee, as 50 years of detente were upended in a matter of hours. “We don’t know much,” said Boaz Shapira, a researcher with the Alma Foundation, a think tank dedicated to issues in northern Israel. “The situation that we were used to in Syria in the past – 50 years with the Assad regime – has changed completely.” Bashar al-Assad was hardly an ally, but there was an understanding that allowed the countries to coexist. Though Israel occasionally to casualties of Syria’s civil war, it maintained official neutrality in the conflict. The Israeli military has also for years targeted supply lines of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Syria – most notably in the Iranian consulate in Damascus, in April – but avoided targeting the Assad regime itself. The rebels’ rapid capture of Damascus means that Israeli leaders will have to evaluate the implications for their own security. Iran has now lost one of its most important bulwarks in the region. That will be cause for celebration in Israel, which has been fighting Iranian-backed forces in Gaza (Hamas) and Lebanon (Hezbollah) since October last year. Netanyahu, who declared that the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was a step towards changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come,” will see this as advancing that goal. Mordechai Kedar, who specialized in Syria affairs during a 25-year career in Israeli military intelligence, said that the events in Syria were a domino effect from Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. “It’s not only Israel – it’s the whole Middle East will celebrate,” he told CNN. The collapse of the Assad regime is a “severe blow” for Iran, said Amos Yadlin, a former major general in the Israel Defense Forces, who also served as chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate. “The rebels tearing down posters of (Iranian commander Qasem) Soleimani and Nasrallah from the Iranian embassy in Damascus illustrate the severity of the blow to the axis,” he said. “Rebuilding Hezbollah seems even more difficult with the loss of Syria, which was a logistical rearguard for weapons from Assad, Iran, and Russia.” On the other hand, no one quite knows – including in Israel – who the rebels are who now control Syria, and how they will implement their power. The offensive was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was formerly an al Qaeda affiliate. The US Government still has a $10 million bounty on the head of its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, whose real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa. Kedar said that despite their radical roots, the opening indications were positive. “So far, they are rather rational,” he said. “For example, they are leaving the government to run the country.” Jolani has called on rebel forces to leave state institutions unharmed. “To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former Prime Minister until they are officially handed over, and it is also forbidden to fire bullets into the air,” he wrote on Telegram. “Here, they are learning from the mistakes of the American in Iraq. They don’t want to destroy the country. They want the system to work – of course under different rules and different leadership. This is a very rational way to run the country.” Yadlin said that Jolani had “demonstrated great political sophistication and conquered Syria almost without a fight.” “In the short term, the rebels are not a threat to Israel,” he said. “When he is required to establish his rule in Syria, he will not get involved with the most powerful military force in the region. Israel needs to shape the rules of the game against Syria in the same aggressive manner in which it does so in Lebanon.” That view is not universal. Israel’s Minister of Diaspora and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chiklisaid that “the bottom line is that most of Syria is now under the control of affiliates of al-Qaeda and Daesh.” He called for the Israeli military to establish full control within the buffer zone that has since 1974 existed between Israeli- and Syrian-controlled territory. Indeed, Israel’s top priority will be securing its border with Syria. The IDF said the deployment of troops within the Golan buffer zone was made “to ensure the safety of the communities of the Golan Heights and the citizens of Israel.” Shapira said he doubted Israel would want to provoke the new leaders in Damascus by pushing into Syrian-controlled Golan. “Taking more territory means we have to deal with other players who might not be so happy about it,” he added. “There are dozens of different militias,” Shapira said. “It’s going to be very challenging for Israel.” The Israeli military, in its statement about operations in the Golan, said: “The State of Israel does not interfere in in the domestic conflict within Syria.” Israel’s top security and political leaders have been mostly mum on events in Syria – no doubt, as they evaluate how to react. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that Assad’s ouster emphasized the need “to create a strong regional coalition with Saudi Arabia and the Abraham Accords countries (Bahrain, UAE, Morocco, Sudan) in order to jointly address regional instability. The Iranian axis has weakened significantly, and Israel needs to strive for a comprehensive political achievement that will also assist it in Gaza and the West Bank.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

After a day of intrigue, the mystery was solved when Russian state media announced he had landed in Moscow. “Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia, for humanitarian reasons, has granted them asylum,” a Kremlin source said, according to TASS. Since the began, and the rebels rapidly advanced through the country, Assad had kept a low profile. After meeting with Iran’s foreign minister last weekend, he pledged to fight “terrorist organizations” but has otherwise made little comment as the rebels captured major cities. On Saturday, as the rebels encircled Damascus, a source told CNN that Assad was nowhere to be found in the city. Assad’s Presidential Guard were also no longer deployed at his usual residence, as they would be if he was there, the source said, fueling speculation ahead of Sunday’s developments that he may have escaped. Syria’s presidential office initially denied that Assad had left Damascus or travelled to another country, saying that some foreign media outlets were “spreading rumors and false news.” After the rebels took the capital, they said he had fled and were searching for him. Some of the fighters along with civilians began ransacking his official residences. Amid the rumors, Russia’s foreign ministry issued a statement Sunday saying Assad had “decided to leave the presidential post and left the country, giving instructions to transfer power peacefully.” The statement added that Russia “did not participate in these negotiations.” Later came the disclosure that Assad had arrived in Moscow. A source close to the rebels told CNN that the ousted president had left Damascus under Russian protection, and a separate source said he traveled to Latakia in northwest Syria, where Russia has an airbase. Flight tracking data shows that a plane departed from Damascus airport at just before 2 a.m. local time on Sunday in the direction of the coast before making a sudden U-turn over the city of Homs and disappearing off the map. CNN cannot confirm whether Assad was on this flight. Russia was the obvious destination – President Vladimir Putin was a longtime ally and supported the Syrian regime with air power and other military aid. Whether Moscow is Assad’s permanent destination, it is an abrupt and ignominious end to more than two decades in power. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The US leader described it as “historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future” while cautioning that it was also a moment of risk and uncertainty in the region. • The leader of the main rebel group, called the toppling of Assad a in his first public remarks in Damascus. The rebels — led by Jolani’s HTS group, which was formed out of an Al Qaeda affiliate — have said will be protected. US President Joe Biden said that the fall of the Assad regime is an act of justice that is allowing Syrians a historic opportunity. “At long last the Assad regime has fallen. This regime brutalized and tortured and killed literally hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. It’s a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country,” Biden said in remarks from the White House on Sunday. Overthrown Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow after being granted asylum in Russia, according to Russian state media TASS, citing a source in the Kremlin. “Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia, for humanitarian reasons, has granted them asylum,” the Kremlin source said, according to TASS Syrian rebel forces reached additional cells in the notorious Saydnaya prison on Sunday, freeing more prisoners from inhumane conditions after seizing the capital Damascus and toppling the Assad regime. In one video streamed online by , rebel forces can be seen breaking down walls with sledgehammers, after the discovery of prison cells that appeared to be hidden. Footage shows hundreds of men shuffling out of the extremely overcrowded prison. “We are kept in the dormitory, with 25 people crammed together,” one released prisoner can be heard telling a rebel fighter in the Al Jazeera video. “We only know some of each other’s names because we are forced to sit and look down at all times.” The freed detainee, from Aleppo, said he had been imprisoned since 2019 for trying to run from regime military service. He said he was once hit on the head with a hammer by Syrian regime guards and detailed the brutality of the Syrian forces, who held control of the prison just days before. “The day before yesterday, at 4 a.m. in the morning, they took us out. They took 60 people from our block. Two (guards from the regime forces) with pump-action shotguns escorted us and took three of our group, saying they were being taken for execution,” the freed detainee said in the video. Other social media videos circulating Sunday showed women and at least one child being freed from the prison. Meanwhile, video from outside the prison walls shows people searching for their imprisoned loved ones. A by the United Nations Human Rights Council detailed “widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” in detention facilities of the Syrian regime. In 2017, an Amnesty International report claimed as many as 13,000 people had been hanged from 2011 to 2015 at Saydnaya Prison in a secret crackdown on dissent against the Assad regime. US President Joe Biden will address the extraordinary fall of the Assad regime in Syria in remarks on Sunday following a stunning and rapid rebel advance, the White House announced. Biden is scheduled to speak at 1 p.m. ET in the Roosevelt Room, according to updated guidance released by the White House. The president also received an update on the situation Sunday morning from his national security team. This will mark Biden’s first substantive remarks on the latest developments in the conflict after US officials took care not to insert itself into the war. One of the key rebel groups leading the offensive, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, has been designated by the US as a terrorist organization. The Biden administration is keenly aware that the end of the Assad regime — and what happens next — could fundamentally reshape the balance of power in the Middle East. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that Europe would help to rebuild a Syria that is safe for all minorities after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. “Europe is ready to support safeguarding national unity and rebuilding a Syrian state that protects all minorities,” she said in a post on “The cruel Assad dictatorship has collapsed. This historic change in the region offers opportunities but is not without risks,” she added. Saudi Arabia expressed its support Sunday for the choices of the Syrian people. “The Kingdom affirms its support for the brotherly Syrian people and their choices at this critical stage in Syria’s history, and calls for concerted efforts to preserve the unity of the epic Syrian people, in a way that protects them – God willing – from slipping into chaos and division,” a statement from the Saudi foreign ministry read. The kingdom said it was satisfied with the “positive steps” taken to ensure the Syrian people’s safety as rebel forces took Damascus, ending the long rule of President Bashar al-Assad. People celebrated in the streets of the Syrian capital as questions now arise about what the transition to a governing authority will look like. Saudi Arabia called on the international community to “not interfere” in Syria’s internal affairs and to help Syrians overcome the difficulties they went through “over many long years, during which hundreds of thousands of innocent people were killed and millions were displaced and refugees, and during which foreign militias ravaged Syria to impose foreign agendas on the Syrian people.” US officials reached out on to Syrian opposition forces on Thursday about , a freelance journalist held in Syria since 2012, hoping to learn more about his whereabouts, a US official told CNN. As Syrian rebels raced toward Damascus, social media was flooded with videos of prisons being flung open and prisoners held for years being freed by the Syrian rebels. The opposition’s advance gave US officials both hope and concern about what it would mean for Tice. Syrian rebels claimed control of Syria’s most notorious prison, Saydnaya Prison, on Sunday. The Biden administration has been operating under the belief that Tice is alive but his condition and location are unknown. Tice was captured near Damascus over 12 years ago and on Friday his family said they had a new source who told them Tice is alive and has been treated well. A source familiar with the Biden administration’s assessment told CNN there had been no change in what they knew. , Tice family members expressed profound frustration with how the Biden administration has answered their questions and handled the case of their son. CNN has asked the National Security Council for comment. The red, white, green and black Free Syrian Army flag flew over Damascus on Sunday as thousands of residents lined the main square in bursts of defiant jubilation – after President Bashar al-Assad relinquished his grip on power. Over the past 11 days, a rebel alliance charged through Syria in the boldest challenge to the Assad rule in years – following decades of brutal reign by the Assad dynasty marked by fighting, bloodshed and an oppressive political crackdown. “This is a momentous moment, not just for the Syrian people, but for the people of the Middle East, Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians or otherwise,” Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Middle East Institute, told CNN on Sunday. “This is a regime that, for over 50 years, under the mantra of freedom, unity and socialism, oppressed, tortured and disappeared many millions in Syria.” Now, as the anti-regime coalition starts to disband Assad’s military, and lays out its vision for a post-Assad Syria, experts wonder if the next phase will be a new dawn for a people strangled by a brutal autocracy – or whether sectarianism will bring a different type of authoritarian rule. Syria’s armed opposition ultimately plans to form a government defined by institutions and a “council chosen by the people,” Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the militant figure driving the latest rebel swing, told CNN. He heads the dominant group in the coalition, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), a former Al Qaeda affiliate. As many in Syria celebrated the end of the , rumors swirled about his whereabouts. Assad had not been seen or heard from since rebels declared Damascus “liberated” after sweeping through the capital and seizing key sites. The location of his wife and two children were also not known. Since the began, and the rebels rapidly advanced through the country, Assad kept a low profile. After meeting with Iran’s foreign minister last weekend, he pledged to fight “terrorist organizations” but otherwise made little comment as the rebels captured major cities. On Saturday, as the rebels encircled Damascus, a source told CNN that Assad was nowhere to be found in the city. But about an hour ago, there was finally an answer. Russian state media arrived in Moscow and been granted asylum by the government. The leader of the main group behind Syria’s armed opposition, called the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad a “victory for the entire Islamic nation” in his first public remarks since the rebels captured Damascus. “This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region,” said the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), a group that was formed out of a former Al Qaeda affiliate. In a speech delivered inside a mosque in the capital, Jolani added that Syria had been a “playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,” but now, “Syria is being purified by the grace of God Almighty and through the efforts of the heroic Mujahideen.” Iran and its proxy Hezbollah were key backers of Assad’s government. “This is a nation that, if its rights are taken, will continue to demand them until they are restored,” Jolani said, adding that HTS was liberating people who were imprisoned by the Assad regime. “My brothers, I left this land over 20 years ago, and my heart longed for this moment,” Jolani said to the crowd gathered at Umayyad mosque. “There is not a single household in Syria that the war has not touched. Praise be to God, today Syria is recovering.” Rebel fighters walk into the Syrian presidential palace Sunday after they captured Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled the country. US President Joe Biden is set to receive an update Sunday morning from his national security team on the extraordinary , the White House said. “President Biden will meet with his national security team this morning to receive an update on the situation on Syria,” National Security Council spokesperson . The Biden administration is keenly aware that the end of the Assad regime — and what happens next — could fundamentally reshape the balance of power in the Middle East. Biden has been closely monitoring the “extraordinary” events, Savett said in an earlier statement, and the administration has been “in constant touch with regional partners.” In every crisis lies opportunity, and in every opportunity lurks crisis. The startling advance of Syria’s opposition in a week is the unintended consequence of two other conflicts, one near and one far. It leaves several key US allies with a new and largely unknown Islamist-led force, governing swathes of their strategic neighbor – if not most of it, given the pace of events, by the time you read this. Syria has absorbed so much diplomatic oxygen in the past 20 years, it is fitting this week of sweeping change popped up as if from a vacuum. Since the invasion of Iraq, the US has struggled to find a policy for Syria that could accommodate the vastly different needs of its allies Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and its sometime partners Iraq and Lebanon. Syria has always been the wing-nut of the region: linking Iraq’s oil to the Mediterranean, the Shia of Iraq and Iran to Lebanon, and NATO’s southern underbelly Turkey to Jordan’s deserts. George W Bush put it in his Axis of Evil; Barack Obama didn’t want to touch it much in case he broke it further; Donald Trump bombed it once, very quickly. It has been in the grip of a horrifically brutal dictatorship for decades. There seemed little more you could subject Syria to, until this week brought it liberation, thus far at an unknown cost, with vast caveats. The swiftly changing fate of Bashar al-Assad was not really made in Syria, but in southern Beirut and Donetsk. Without the physical crutches of Russia’s air force and Iran’s proxy muscle Hezbollah, he toppled when finally pushed. The Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson has issued an “urgent warning” to residents in southern Syria on Sunday. In a , Avichay Adraee issued warnings for five areas. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the country’s military to seize the buffer zone on Israel’s border with Syria Sunday. Addressing Syrian citizens, Adraee said that “fighting in your area is forcing the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to take action, and we do not intend to harm you.” “For your safety, please remain in your homes and do not go outside until further notice,” he said. The long rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is over, after rebels swept into the capital Damascus. The fighters declared the city “liberated” in a statement carried on state television as Syrians celebrated the fall of Assad’s regime in the streets. The long rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is over, after rebels swept into the capital Damascus. The fighters declared the city “liberated” in a statement carried on state television as Syrians celebrated the fall of Assad's regime in the streets. Iraq has urged “non-interference in Syria’s internal affairs” and said it wouldn’t accept foreign meddling in the country. Baghdad “reaffirms the necessity of respecting the free will of all Syrians and emphasizes that Syria’s security, territorial integrity, and its independence are of utmost importance — not only for Iraq but also for the stability and security of the entire region,” government spokesperson Bassem Al-Awadi said Sunday. The Iraqi government supports efforts to initiate an “inclusive dialogue encompassing all factions and orientations in the Syrian arena, in accordance with the interests of the Syrian people,” he continued, including the establishment of a constitution that safeguards the rights of Syrians and “supports Syria’s rich cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity.” But if outside sources try to meddle in Syrian affairs, this will “only deepen the conflict and divisions in Syria,” Al-Awadi warned. The Taliban’s foreign ministry on Sunday congratulated the Syrian people and rebel forces, in particular , which led the sweeping rebel offensive, in the wake of the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Afghanistan “congratulates the leadership of the movement and the people of Syria on the recent developments, which have resulted in the removal of key factors contributing to conflict and instability,” the Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement. “We express hope that the process of power transition be carried out in a manner aligned with the aspirations of the Syrian people, paving path for the establishment of an independent and service-oriented Islamic government, which prioritizes national reconciliation, avoids divisions and retribution, and adopts a policy of general amnesty to foster unity among all Syrians,” it said.

Syrians have been in the streets. The removal of Assad brings an end to more than 50 years of his family’s autocratic rule of the nation of about 23 million, which has been fractured by more than a decade of civil war. The Lebanese army has deployed reinforcement troops along its eastern and northern borders with Syria, according to an army statement released on Sunday. “The units tasked with monitoring and controlling the northern and eastern borders have been reinforced, in conjunction with tightening monitoring procedures. Units deployed throughout Lebanon are also implementing exceptional measures to maintain security and protect civil peace,” the army said. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati held a call Sunday with leaders of the army and security services, during which he stressed “the priority of tightening control over the border situation and distancing Lebanon from the repercussions of the developments in Syria,” according to a government readout. The prime minister also highlighted the need to bolster the capabilities of Lebanon’s national commission for missing people “in light of the release of hundreds of prisoners from Syrian prisons.” Many of the citizens that disappeared during Lebanon’s long civil war are thought to be held in Syrian prisons, particularly the infamous , with some having been reported missing since the 1970s. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said that he had ordered the military to “take control” of the buffer zone that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. It would be the first time Israeli troops would be stationed in the buffer zone since a 1974 agreement establishing the line of control between Israel and Syria, though they have in the past entered the no-man’s land for brief periods. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. Most international powers, except for the United States, recognize it as occupied Syrian territory. “Together with the defense minister, and with full backing from the cabinet, I directed the IDF yesterday to take control of the buffer zone and the dominant positions near it,” Netanyahu said while visiting the Golan Heights. “We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.” The Israel Defense Forces announced the deployment, saying it was done “to ensure the safety of the communities of the Golan Heights and the citizens of Israel” after Syrian troops reportedly abandoned their posts. The military’s statement added that “the IDF is not interfering with the internal events in Syria.” Netanyahu also said that the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria was “a direct result” of Israel’s military campaign against Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. “This is a historic day in the history of the Middle East,” he said. Israel is “pursuing a policy of good neighborliness,” he said. Iran will respect Syria’s “unity, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. “Determining Syria’s fate and deciding its future is solely the responsibility of its people, free from destructive interference or external imposition,” the ministry said. “Achieving this goal requires the swift cessation of military conflicts, prevention of terrorist activities, and the initiation of national dialogues with the participation of all segments of Syrian society. These steps aim to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Syria,” the statement said. “The Islamic Republic of Iran, emphasizing Syria’s status as an important and influential country in the West Asia region, will spare no effort to help establish security and stability in Syria,” it continued. “To this end, Iran will continue its consultations with all influential parties, particularly within the region.” The foreign ministry added that it expects “friendly” relations to continue with Syria, despite the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Iran and its proxy Hezbollah were key backers of Assad. A US official told CNN earlier that events in Syria mark the collapse of “Iran’s artifice” across the Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron has commended the fall of what he called a “barbaric state” on Sunday, as rebels toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and took the capital city Damascus. “The barbaric state has fallen. At last,” Macron said on . “I pay tribute to the Syrian people, to their courage, to their patience. In this moment of uncertainty, I send them my wishes for peace, freedom, and unity. France will remain committed to the security of all in the Middle East.” Also on , EU foreign policy chief said that the end of Assad’s rule in the country is a “positive and long-awaited development,” adding that she is in close contact with ministers from the region. “Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and in the region,” she said. “The process of rebuilding Syria will be long and complicated and all parties must be ready to engage constructively.” German Foreign Minister the end of the Assad regime “a big relief for millions of people in Syria.” She urged that “the country must not fall into the hands of other radicals - under whatever disguise. We therefore call on all parties to the conflict to act with regard to their responsibility for all Syrians.” Meanwhile, Ukranian Foreign Minister that Assad’s ties with Russia may have helped to bring him down. “Assad has fallen. This is how it has always been and will always be for dictators who bet on Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him. The main goal now is to restore security in Syria and effectively protect its people from violence,” Sybiha said. The international community must rally behind the Syrian people following the toppling of , Turkey’s foreign minister said on Sunday. “Today, there is hope,” Hakan Fidan said at a news conference in Doha, Qatar. “The Syrian people cannot achieve this alone. The international community must support the Syrian people.” Fidan said that Turkey calls on “all actors in and outside the region to act with prudence and calm and to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the region,” adding that it will be watchful of groups like ISIS and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) who could take advantage of the instability in Syria. “With this understanding, we will continue to support a force to establish stability and security in Syria,” he said. Fidan said that Turkey appreciated the “constructive approaches of Russia and Iran,” who he said came together on Saturday to discuss the situation with Turkey and the United Nations’ Special Envoy for Syria. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan also contributed to discussions, he said. The rebel groups that have toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad seem intent on avoiding a power vacuum in the country, HA Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN on Sunday. “The question, I think, is going to be: How are these rebels going to transition into a more governing authority?” he said. Thus far, Hellyer said, he is cautiously optimistic that the rebels “are intent on trying to avoid a vacuum (or) a very chaotic sort of transfer.” “I hope that the region and the international community more generally is also very focused on this point,” he said. “They will need help. They will need assistance. And I think it’s to everyone’s interest regionally, but also internationally, that Syria gets back on its feet.” Hellyer suggested that there are many reasons why the international community should put in “as much effort” as possible to help in the “rebuilding of huge portions of the country,” including reasons related to security and migration. Jordan’s King Abdullah on Sunday urged stability and avoidance of further conflict in Syria, as the long rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ended with rebel forces taking the capital Damascus. “Chairing a National Security Council meeting, His Majesty stressed the need to safeguard Syria’s security, and the safety and achievements of its citizens, and to work urgently to ensure stability and avoid any conflict that could lead to chaos,” a statement from The Royal Hashemite Court said, in one of the first reactions from a regional nation. Jordan shares its northern border with Syria. The King added that “Jordan stands with the Syrian people and respects their will and choices,” according to the statement. Syrian rebels have swept into the capital Damascus and declared the city “liberated,” bringing a sudden end to the long rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia’s foreign ministry say Assad has left the country and given instructions to transfer power peacefully. There have been jubilant scenes in Damascus — one man said his feelings were “indescribable.” A television anchor read the first news bulletin on Syrian state television on Sunday after the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was toppled overnight. “To those who bet on us and to those who didn’t, to those who thought one day that we were broken, we announce to you from the Syrian news channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution after 13 years of patience and sacrifice,” anchor Youssef Al-Youssef said. “We won the bet and toppled the criminal Assad regime. Here we are now with a news brief from the building of the General Authority for Radio and Television in the Syrian capital, Damascus, presented to you by me, Youssef Al-Youssef,” he said, before providing a brief news summary. Considering the fact that Russia has been one of the Assad government’s most important backers for nearly ten years, the coverage of the rebels’ takeover of Damascus has been muted on Russian state media. The country’s state news channel, Rossiya 24, led its broadcasts with the news on Sunday morning, but instead of the wall-to-wall coverage seen on Western and Middle Eastern networks, the reports were short and very matter of fact. “Armed groups occupied the building of state radio and TV, located in the center of Damascus,” the Russian report said, showing opposition forces apparently entering the government media compound. After about a minute, coverage moved on to other news, mostly about the war in Ukraine. Russian news agencies also had mostly secondary coverage of the historic events unfolding in Syria, often citing Western and Middle Eastern media. On the main page of the official TASS news agency, Syria ranked as only one of several headline stories rather than major breaking news treatment. This is in line with the low-key response from Russian authorities about the collapse of the Assad government. The Kremlin has so far not officially commented on the events, however Russia’s foreign ministry on Sunday afternoon confirming that Bashar al-Assad had left the country, while claiming that Russia played no role in the negotiations for the transfer of power. Syrian rebels have declared a 13-hour curfew in the capital Damascus from 4 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) Sunday until 5 a.m. (9 p.m. ET) Monday, according to a statement by their Military Operations Command on Telegram. The Syrian capital is witnessing a significant armed rebel presence and continuous celebratory gunfire, live videos showed. A message on Syrian state television earlier called on people not to “terrify” civilians by firing weapons in public squares. Presidential palaces have also been , and heavy traffic has been reported in the capital. Syria’s foreign ministry and its embassies abroad will remain operational to serve Syrians, the foreign ministry said in its first statement since the rebel takeover of Damascus. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in the Syrian Arab Republic and its diplomatic missions abroad will remain committed to serving all fellow citizens and managing their affairs,” it said on Sunday. “Today, a new page is being written in the history of Syria inaugurating a national covenant and charter to unite Syrians and does not divide them,” the statement said. Syrian rebels and civilians have been seen touring and ransacking residences of the country’s now former President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. Children were seen running into the entrance of Assad’s Al Rawda presidential palace as men walked out with furniture, according to a video published by Reuters. An armed man was seen carrying a rifle in the palace. Another video posted on social media showed the hallways of what appeared to be another residence in the capital, with the sound of men and women celebrating. “This is the people’s money,” one man was heard saying. CNN was not able to geolocate the video. A video geolocated by CNN showed a woman touring the kitchen of a home in the Al Maliki neighborhood of Damascus that was described as a “presidential palace.” The well-equipped kitchen included an industrial freezer and a pizza oven. The kitchen was still stocked with fruit, vegetables and fish. A notebook showed a menu “for the madame” and “the boss” including notes on their culinary preferences, as well as recipes. “Food for the madame: She does not like spinach – we will not cook it again. Tomorrow we will cook salmon or Latakia fish,” one entry in the notepad said, according to the video filmed by the woman in the kitchen. President Bashar al-Assad has left Syria, Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday. Assad “decided to leave the presidential post and left the country, giving instructions to transfer power peacefully,” the statement said, adding that “Russia did not participate in these negotiations.” “The Russian Federation is in contact with all groups of the Syrian opposition,” it said. Before the Russian foreign ministry issued its statement, a source close to the rebels told CNN that the ousted president had left Damascus under Russian protection, and a separate source said he traveled to Latakia in northwest Syria, where Russia has an airbase. Working out a new governing system in Syria would be “extremely challenging” for the rebels that have toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst on jihad in modern conflict at the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group, told CNN Sunday. “It’s going to be extremely challenging for the whole coalition [of rebel groups], because it’s (a) diverse coalition,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Some groups are more structured, more organized, including [Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham] and some of its allies,” he said, whereas others are “more local entities.” States like Turkey and Qatar will likely help with the stabilization of the country, as well as other Gulf and European nations, Drevon said, adding that Gulf Arab countries will likely step in to “favor their own interests.” In the first state television interview with the rebels, a commander introduced as the leader of the operation to overthrow Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Damascus assured that minorities in Syria would be protected, emphasizing that the country belongs to all Syrians. “We address all the sects of Syria: Syria is for everyone, without exception… Syria is for the Sunni, the Druze, the Alawite. We don’t deal with people like the Assad (regime) did,” the commander said when asked by the interviewer to reassure minorities concerned for their safety after the fall of the Assad regime. He also called on Syrians to “safeguard all the government institutions.” The broadcast was cut mid-interview after the sound failed. Syrians in the capital city of Damascus are celebrating the fall of , after rebel forces entered the city with scant resistance from regime forces and declared it liberated. Thousands gathered in cars and on foot in the main square of Damascus to celebrate. Omar Daher, a 29-year-old lawyer, said his feelings were “indescribable.” “After the fear that he [Assad] and his father made us live in for many years, and the panic and state of terror that I was living in, I can’t believe it,” he told the Associated Press. Another Damascus resident, Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, said he wasn’t able to sleep last night until he heard the news of Assad’s fall. “From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.” A local named Ghazal al-Sharif declared that “God had answered” the prayer of “every oppressed person.” The removal of Assad – who has not been heard from since the rebels’ claim – brings an end to more than 50 years of his family’s autocratic rule of the nation of about 23 million, which has been buffeted and fractured by more than a decade of civil war. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is “probably outside Syria,” Turkey’s foreign minister said on Sunday. Asked by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, if he knew where Assad might be, Hakan Fidan said: “I cannot comment on that, probably outside of Syria.” There is conflicting information on Assad’s whereabouts - an eastern European agency believes he is in Latakia, his coastal stronghold. The Syrian leader has not been seen or heard from publicly since rebels entered the capital early on Sunday morning. The Syrian rebels taking Damascus and toppling the country’s President Bashar al-Assad is a “momentous moment” for the Middle East, Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told CNN Sunday. “This is a momentous moment, not just for the Syrian people, but for the people of the Middle East, Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians, or otherwise,” he said. “What happens in Syria doesn’t stay in Syria.” “This is a regime that, for over 50 years, under the mantra of freedom, unity and socialism, oppressed, tortured and disappeared many millions in Syria,” Maksad said. The regime also oppressed Lebanese and Palestinian people when the Assad regime occupied Lebanon for several years, he said. “There’s no doubt that this is a joyous moment for many at a human level,” he said, but it could also be a “moment of potential peril” for minority communities in the country, including religious groups like Alawites, Ismailis, Druze and Christians. “There are concerns about the more Islamist jihadi elements of this rebel force,” he said, particularly when it comes to Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the main group driving the country’s armed opposition, which has been designated a terrorist group by the US and many other countries. Syrian rebels appear to have taken control of Syrian state TV, with the channel breaking regular programing to run a message announcing the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. The message, accompanied by revolutionary and patriotic music, declared the “victory for the great Syrian revolution and the overthrow of the criminal Assad regime.” “We call upon the great Syrian people to protect public and private properties,” another message on state TV read. As images of prisoners being released surfaced following the seizure of the notorious Saydnaya Prison by Syrian rebels on Sunday, many Syrians took to social media seeking help to locate imprisoned and missing family members. Social media videos and photos taken inside the facility following its capture by the rebels revealed cramped cells and horrific living conditions. They also showed scenes of women being released, as well as a child. Other scenes revealed weary former prisoners, many jubilant after being released, with some receiving medical treatment. With the fates of many prisoners still uncertain, families reacted with a mix of fear and hope, waiting to learn whether their loved ones had been freed. One commentor on Facebook said: “Liberating Syria from the slaughterhouse of Saydnaya brings more joy than the joy of toppling the tyrant.” Others shared pictures asking for any information about family members who had been held in the prison. Some users have begun posting the names of released prisoners to assist families awaiting news of their loved ones. “We ask all families, revolutionaries, and journalists to photograph the released detainees so that their families can recognize them,” one commentor wrote. In 2017, an Amnesty International report claimed as many as 13,000 people had been hanged from 2011 to 2015 at Saydnaya Prison in a secret crackdown on dissent against the Assad regime. US President-elect Donald Trump took to social media early Sunday morning to weigh in on the of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. “Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place,” he said, adding “They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine.” “Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,” Trump said. The president-elect then highlighted the number of soldiers killed on both sides in Russia’s war on Ukraine and called for an end to the fighting. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin,” he wrote without specifying which conflict he was referring to. Russia has been waging war in Ukraine for over two years, leaving it with less military might to cover Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Syria. For Russia, Syria’s fall means and undermining its ability to project power while it fights its war in Ukraine. Iran’s embassy in Damascus was stormed after the of the Syrian capital, Iranian state-run Press TV said. Separately, a video published on Saudi state media showed what appeared to be damage to the Iranian embassy and a torn poster of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who was responsible for building a network of Iran-alled militias in Syria to support the Assad regime before he was killed by a US airstrike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The collapse of the Assad government has strong implications for Iran, which was one of the Syrian president’s key backers. One US official told CNN that events in Syria mark the across the Middle East. The toppling of Assad follows the decimation of key Tehran proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in conflicts with Israel over the past 14 months. iron-fisted leader Bashar al-Assad is the second generation of an autocratic family dynasty that held power for more than five decades and signals an astonishing reordering of power in a strategically vital Middle Eastern nation. Assad is known for a brutal rule over Syria, which since 2011 has been devastated by a civil war that ravaged the country and turned it into a breeding ground for extremist group ISIS, while sparking an international proxy war and that saw millions displaced from their homes. Assad took power in an unopposed election in 2000 following the death of his father Hafez al-Assad, who rose from poverty to lead the Baath Party and seized power in 1970, becoming the country’s president the following year. Like the son who succeeded him, Hafez al-Assad tolerated little dissent with oppression widespread and periodic bouts of extreme state violence. As a second son not poised to take up his father’s mantle, Assad studied ophthalmology in London until his older brother Bassel, who had been groomed to succeed Hafez, died in a car crash in 1994. Bashar al-Assad was then thrust into the national spotlight and studied military science, later becoming a colonel in the Syrian army. Western hopes of a more moderate Syria under Assad sank when he promptly maintained his country’s traditional ties with militant groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. They then turned to outright condemnation of the regime after he met the 2011 pro-democracy groundswell with brutal force. Syria then descended into civil war which has lasted since then and culminated in this week’s extraordinary events. A video showed Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi Al-Jalali being escorted by rebels in Damascus on Sunday, purportedly to a hotel to hand over government authority. The video showed Jalali surrounded by armed men walking down some steps and entering a black SUV with another man. “The former prime minister is with the 5th Corps from the people of Hauran heading to the Four Seasons Hotel for a meeting and to hand over the country’s institutions to the heroes of the Free Army,” a man is heard saying in the video. The prime minister said earlier he wants to “ensure” the operation of public institutions, state facilities, and the preservation of “safety and security for all citizens.” Syrian rebels have after entering the city to scant resistance from regime forces, while claiming President Bashar al-Assad has fled the capital, losing his decades-long grip on power. An active search is underway for Assad, according to a source familiar with the rebels’ operations. The Syrian leader has not been seen or heard from publicly since rebels entered the capital early on Sunday morning. The removal of Assad – who has not been heard from since the rebels’ claim – would bring an end to more than 50 years of his family’s autocratic rule of the nation of about 23 million, which has been buffeted and fractured by more than a decade of civil war. Meanwhile, Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said the government stood ready “to cooperate with any leadership the people choose.” People have taken to the streets across Syria, following the news that rebel forces have entered the capital Damascus. The seizing of Damascus comes after a lightning offensive by the rebels, who say they’ve also “fully liberated” the city of Homs, just over a week after they captured Aleppo. Israel’s military have deployed forces into the buffer zone between Israel and Syria in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a statement on Sunday. “Following the recent events in Syria, including the entry of armed personnel into the buffer zone, the IDF has deployed forces in the buffer zone and in several other places necessary for its defense, to ensure the safety of the communities of the Golan Heights and the citizens of Israel,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The military said it would continue to operate as long as necessary in the area “to preserve the buffer zone and defend Israel and its civilians.” “We emphasize that the IDF is not interfering with the internal events in Syria,” the statement added. : The Golan Heights is that Israeli seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon. Syria’s capital Damascus is visible from atop the rocky Golan. The Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations. The Golan Heights is considered to be occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and Syria continues to demand it be returned. Syria’s rebel coalition consists of Islamist and moderate factions who, despite their differences, are united in fighting the Assad regime, ISIS and Iran-backed militias. Here are some of the groups forming the coalition: The most prominent and formidable of the groups is HTS, also known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant. HTS was founded by , a military commander who gained experience as a young fighter for al Qaeda against the United States in Iraq. He created Jabhat al-Nusra, al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, and operated the group until a public split with in 2016 over ideological differences and opposition to ISIS. Jolani formed HTS in 2017. Despite Jolani’s effort to distance HTS from al Qaeda and ISIS, the US and other Western countries designated it a terrorist organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on him. The “Syrian National Army” incorporates dozens of factions with various ideologies that receive funding and arms from Turkey. That coalition includes the , comprising factions like Ahrar al-Sham whose stated aims are to “overthrow the (Assad) regime” and “establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law.” Complicating matters is that some members of the rebel coalition are also fighting Kurdish forces. The Turkish-backed said last week it had seized control of the city of and other towns and villages in the northern part of the Aleppo governorate. Those territories were previously held not by Assad’s government but by another faction involved in the multi-front civil war: the . The SDF are largely made up of Kurdish fighters from a group known as the (YPG), which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey. In Syria’s south, fighters from the country’s have also joined the fight, a local activist group told CNN. Druze are fighting in the southern city of as-Suwayda, which neighbors the Daraa province, where opposition forces claim to have taken control of Daraa city. Rebel fighters declared the Syrian capital of Damascus “liberated” in a televised statement carried on state television on Sunday. “Damascus has been liberated and the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has been overthrown, and oppressed prisoners in regime prisons have been released,” a spokesperson said reading from a statement surrounded by roughly a dozen other rebels. “We ask people and fighters to protect all property in Free Syria…long live Syria free for all Syrians of all sects,” he added. The rebels moved to capture the state media offices early on Sunday morning after entering Damascus. : Syrian rebels previously claimed they had taken control of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus, according to a statement on Sunday. It is not clear how many other prisons in the capital. Amnesty International dubbed ” in a 2017 report after extensively documenting mass hangings there. A in July 2023 highlighted the “continuing widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including enforced disappearances” inside Syrian detention facilities including Saydnaya. Rebel fighters could be seen on the grounds of the Syrian presidential palace on Sunday. Footage verified by CNN showed fighters by a gate house located on the southern edge of the palace grounds. The men can be seeing firing guns in the air in celebration on the otherwise deserted entrance area. An active search is underway for Bashar al-Assad with rebels questioning Syrian military officers and intelligence officials who might have knowledge about his movements, according to a source familiar with the rebels’ operations. Rebel forces declared Damascus “free” on Sunday, claiming Assad had fled the capital. The Syrian leader has not been seen or heard from publicly since rebels entered the capital early on Sunday morning. One US official told CNN that events in Syria mark the collapse of “Iran’s artifice” across the Middle East. The potential toppling of the Iran-backed Assad would follow the decimation of key Tehran proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in conflicts with Israel over the past 14 months. US President Joe Biden is “closely monitoring” developments in Syria, according to a statement. “President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,” National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett wrote on X. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said the government stands ready “to cooperate with any leadership the people choose,” in a recorded message on Sunday morning. “We are ready to cooperate with any leadership the people choose, offering all possible support to ensure a smooth and systematic transition of government functions, preserving state facilities,” he said. Ghazi al-Jalali called on Syrians to protect public facilities, saying they belonged to all citizens. “I am here in my home, did not leave and do not intend to leave it except in a peaceful manner to ensure the continuing operation of public institutions, state facilities, and to broadcast safety and security for all citizens.” “We extend our hands to every Syrian citizen who is concerned about safeguarding this nation’s assets… I urge all citizens not to harm any public property because, ultimately, it belongs to them.” The militant leader of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), the main group driving the country’s armed opposition, released a statement calling on rebel forces to leave state institutions unharmed. “To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former Prime Minister until they are officially handed over, and it is also forbidden to fire bullets into the air,” Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, wrote on telegram. On Thursday, Jolani projected a different vision for the war-torn country in an interview with CNN. In a sign of his attempted rebranding, he also publicly used his real name for the first time – Ahmed al-Sharaa – instead of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the nom de guerre by which he is widely known. Rebel forces in Syria have declared Damascus “free,” claiming Bashar al-Assad has fled the capital, according to a statement on Sunday. “We declare the city of Damascus free from the tyrant Bashar al-Assad,” the Military Operations Command wrote in a post on Telegram. “To the displaced all over the world, a free Syria awaits you,” the statement added. The rebels earlier claimed to have entered the capital and taken control of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus. Syrian rebels fighting against the government of Bashar al-Assad claim they have taken control of the notorious Saydnaya Military Prison north of Damascus, according to a statement on Sunday. “We broke the news to the Syrian people of liberating our prisoners and unchaining them, and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Saydnaya Prison,” the statement said. Amnesty International dubbed ” in a 2017 report after extensively documenting mass hangings there. A in July 2023 highlighted the “continuing widespread and systematic patterns of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including enforced disappearances” inside Syrian detention facilities including Saydnaya. Syrian rebels are moving to capture state media offices in Damascus, according to a statement on Sunday morning. “The Military Operations Command is moving to seize control of the Radio and Television Building to broadcast the victory announcement over Assad,” the statement said. Earlier in the evening the rebel alliance posted a message to its official Telegram account claiming its “forces began entering the capital.” A resident of the Barzeh neighborhood of Damascus told CNN that rebels were in the area and clashes were taking place. Video shows scenes of chaos at Damascus airport as people attempt to flee rebel advance Scenes of chaos unfolded inside Damascus airport early Sunday morning local time, as Syrian rebel forces continued their lightning advance into the capital city. Footage verified by CNN showed dozens of people quickly passing through security checkpoints and rushing to departure gates in an attempt to flee the country. The airport appeared to be largely unstaffed and flight monitoring websites showed no imminent departures scheduled. Rebel forces appear to have entered the Syrian capital of Damascus, one resident told CNN, as the Assad regime’s defenses showed signs of collapsing. “The rebels are in Barzeh,” a neighborhood inside Damascus city, the resident told CNN, adding that clashes were currently taking place. “I saw rebel fighters moving through the inner alleys of Barzeh toward Police Club Street, and I can hear very loud sounds of clashes. The electricity is cut off, and the internet is very weak, people are staying at their houses.” “Militarily, Damascus has fallen,” a source familiar with the rebels’ advance told CNN. Reconnaissance units had entered Damascus overnight searching for President Bashar al-Assad but were unable to find him, the source added. Special rebel operatives have entered Damascus and are taking up key positions in “strategic places,” the source said. The rebels say they are in touch with senior Assad regime elements who are . Through the day, anti-regime forces have been moving from the north, south and east toward Damascus, reaching suburbs less than 5 miles — and in one case, barely 1 mile — from the center of the Syrian capital. Officials in US President Joe Biden’s administration, watching the remarkable speed of the Syrian rebel advance, increasingly see the possibility of Bashar al-Assad’s regime falling within days, five US officials told CNN. If the American analysis proves true, it would represent a spectacularly fast fall from power for the Syrian dictator after a war that began in 2011, one that had been relatively stagnant until just last week. Officials cautioned that there isn’t a formal assessment that has emerged on Assad’s fate and that views vary, saying his demise isn’t a forgone conclusion. “The emerging consensus is that is an increasingly plausible scenario,” one senior US official said. “Probably by next weekend the Assad regime will have lost any semblance of power,” one said. “Only thing that would delay a rebel conquest would be a well-organized coup and reorganization, but Assad’s folks have done a good job of stifling any potential competitors,” the official added. The Biden administration appeared caught off guard by the speed of the rebel advance that was launched last week. Regime troops have collapsed and melted away, leaving a fragile shell of an army to defend the president and Damascus. The US has misjudged the staying power of regimes before, most recently in Afghanistan — where the US intelligence community judged that the Afghan government would be more resilient than it ultimately was — and in Ukraine, which the US wrongly believed would fall to Russia within days of Russia’s invasion. As a result, in 2022, the US intelligence launched a review of how it assesses the “will to fight” of foreign militaries, CNN has previously reported. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is nowhere to be found in Damascus, a source tells CNN. The official line of the Syrian president’s office is that Assad hasn’t fled the capital. But a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that Assad isn’t at any of the locations in the city where you’d expect to find him. Assad’s Presidential Guard are no longer deployed at his usual place of residence, as they would be if he was there, the source said, fueling speculation he may have escaped Damascus. Traditionally, this guard detail would provide Assad’s inner cordon of security, and some of them would be expected to travel with the president when he is on the move. According to the source, rebel forces have no solid intelligence on Assad’s location and are continuing their efforts to find him. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

In an interview with NBC News that aired Sunday, he also said he would work with Democrats to who were brought to the US as children, known as “Dreamers.” • Trump told “Meet the Press” that members of the January 6 committee that investigated the Capitol insurrection Asked whether he will direct his attorney general or FBI director to go after the committee members, Trump said, “No, not at all. I think that they’ll have to look at that.” On social media, the president-elect weighed in on the escalating situation in Syria. He said the US should not get involved and , both of which supported the Syrian leader. President-elect Donald Trump repeated numerous false claims during an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” — including his old lie that the US is the world’s only country with birthright citizenship. Trump reiterated his intention to try to end birthright citizenship, in which, under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, someone born in the US is granted automatic citizenship even if their parents are not citizens. And he asserted, “We’re the only country that has it.” This is not true; CNN and previously debunked the claim when Trump made it during his presidential campaign in 2015 and . provide automatic citizenship to people born on their soil, including US neighbors Canada and Mexico and the majority of South American countries. : Trump falsely claimed, “Crime is at an all-time high.” That is nowhere close to true. Both violent crime and property crime rates and are far below all-time highs. FBI data shows that crime . : Trump falsely claimed of the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency: “They cost Americans nothing.” after , including , that Americans bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products. The tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters as Trump regularly claims, and it’s easy to find of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers. : Trump falsely claimed that, during his presidency, “We had no inflation.” In fact, cumulative inflation during Trump’s presidency . President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser Stephen Miller reiterated Trump’s pledge to begin mass deportations of undocumented immigrants on Day 1 of his presidency. “The president is going to get his agenda enacted through Congress, and it will be historic,” Miller told Fox News on Sunday. Incoming Senate Republican leader John Thune has already begun outlining a legislative package that centers on border security, as well as energy and defense issues. “This is something that Republicans have been talking about for decades, but with Donald Trump this is something that’s going to happen,” Miller said. “It’ll be the most important and significant … policy achievement in half a century.” Amid concerns that this deportation effort might delay a tax reform package, Miller said the plan is to “move immediately” to this issue after dealing with border security. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who served on the House Select Committee on January 6, said he is “not worried” about President-elect Donald Trump’s that members of the committee should be sent to jail for their investigation into the 2021 Capitol insurrection. “The executive branch can’t go after the legislative branch because we embarrassed him,” Kinzinger told CNN’s Manu Raju Sunday morning on “Inside Politics.” “That’s not a sin, that’s not against the law.” Kinzinger noted that the majority of people who testified before the committee were members of the president-elect’s own party, saying Trump is upset because he was embarrassed. “He’s not going to come after us, and I’m not worried about it at all, in the least,” Kinzinger said. President-elect Donald Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, said families that have mixed immigration status may be deported under his administration. Asked by NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” whether he would deport families with mixed immigration statuses — such as when a child is born in the US to parents who are in the country illegally — Trump said, “I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.” The comments align with those of his pick for “border czar,” former acting ICE Director Tom Homan, who told “60 Minutes” in an interview that “families could be deported together” when asked about Trump’s pledge to immediately upon entering office. He also argued that that effort would be targeted, though exact plans for how it would be carried out — and — remain to be seen. President-elect Donald Trump says he is open to allowing the Department of Health and Human Services, — who has promoted false claims about vaccination — to look into eliminating childhood vaccines. Asked by NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” whether he wants to see childhood vaccines eliminated, Trump said, “If they’re dangerous for the children,” going on to suggest that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been repeatedly disproved. Trump, asked again if he is open to Kennedy looking into getting rid of childhood vaccines, said, “I’m open to anything. I think somebody has to find out.” Kennedy is an environmental lawyer turned medical science and vaccine skeptic. He has promoted false claims about vaccination for years and the nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, which promotes anti-vaccine material. As recently as last summer, Kennedy claimed in interviews that thimerosal, a preservative in some vaccines, was linked to brain damage and autism in children. The studies have not found any evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines. Trump looked to tone down some of the worries around Kennedy’s selection, saying, “He’s not going to upset any system.” Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said Sunday that she “respectfully disagree(s)” with President-elect Donald Trump’s statement that all members of the House Select Committee on the January 6 attack should go to jail. “I obviously think that oversight and investigations is one of the most important functions of the United States Congress, a system of checks and balances,” the Michigan congresswoman told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Dingell said that the committee members she’s spoken with are not interested in securing a blanket pardon from President Joe Biden, saying doing so “implies that what they did was wrong.” “What they were doing was their job,” Dingell said. The question of whether a pardon for the members is needed comes after the president’s controversial pardon of his son Hunter Biden, which has drawn criticism from legislators on both sides of the aisle. While Dingell said she was “surprised” by Biden’s decision to pardon his son, she emphasized the need for the president to consider other pardon requests for private individuals, saying, “We cannot just pardon people who have access to privilege — we need to be looking at this in a far broader way.” During an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday, Trump said “everyone on that committee, for what they did, they should go to jail,” referring to the January 6 committee. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Dick Durbin appeared hesitant about but did not criticize President Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter. “When we talk about a preemptive pardon, where does it start and where does it stop?” the Illinois Democrat told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday. Rep. Adam Schiff, who will be sworn into the Senate this week, has been among the possible names discussed for a preemptive pardon before Biden leaves office. Schiff, who was the lead impeachment manager in Trump’s first impeachment trial, told NPR recently that he did not think preemptive pardons were necessary. Durbin said he stands by Schiff in believing that a preemptive pardon is unnecessary for the senator-elect. The Biden pardon discussion has been reignited by the president’s decision last week to grant a broad pardon to his son Hunter Biden. The pardon ignited some discussion within the Democratic Party, with multiple members of Congress calling out the president for reversing his promise to not pardon his son and what it could mean for the perceived integrity of the Department of Justice. Durbin avoided criticizing the president’s decision, instead talking about Biden’s connection to his family. “It’s a labor of love, as far as I’m concerned, from a loving father,” Durbin said. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview airing Sunday that Ukraine should “possibly, probably” expect less aid in its fight against Russia once he begins his second term. Asked by NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” whether Ukraine should expect less aid from the US when he is again president, Trump said, “Possibly, probably. Sure.” Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have cast doubts on the level of the US’ continued commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and a half years after Russian forces invaded. Trump said he is actively trying to negotiate the end of the war before he takes office but would not say whether he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since winning the election. “I don’t want to say that. I don’t want to say anything about that because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” he said. Trump also would not commit to the US remaining in NATO, saying, “They have to pay their bills.” “If they pay their bills, absolutely,” he continued, adding that “NATO’s taken advantage of us.” Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin defended President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, , despite her history of defending the “Well, a lot of things have taken place since 2017. Her position, obviously because of the actions of Assad and what has happened in Syria has changed. Keep in mind that when she went over there, she was still — now, she wasn’t over there in uniform — but she was a captain in the National Guard,” he said to CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union. Gabbard, who has faced criticism for both her pro-Russia and her pro-Assad rhetoric, as 2019 that she did not regret her trip to Syria to meet with former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. In 2017, Gabbard the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against Syrians despite Trump, who was president at the time, saying there could be “no dispute” the regime did so. But Mullin said Gabbard is “100 percent qualified.” “She has clearances. She’s able to do her job, and I think she’s 100 percent qualified to be the next director of national intelligence … she is perfect for the position,” he said. President-elect Donald Trump in an interview that aired on Sunday stood by his promise to end birthright citizenship as a part of his sweeping immigration plan. Asked by NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” whether it is still his plan to end birthright citizenship, Trump responded, “yeah, absolutely.” The 14th Amendment clearly states that American citizenship is a birthright for all people who are born on American soil. Asked how he would get around the Constitution and 150 years of American law, Trump said, “We’re going to have to get a change. We may have to go to the people, but we have to end it.” He said he would end birthright citizenship “if we can” through executive action. Trump repeatedly said he would look into the idea At the time, the ability of the president to end birthright citizenship was extensively challenged by a range of lawmakers and legal scholars — including one of Trump’s own judicial nominees. President-elect Donald Trump said members of the January 6 committee that investigated the Capitol insurrection should “go to jail.” “(Committee Vice Chair then-Rep. Liz) Cheney was behind it and so was (Committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson), and so was everyone on that committee. For what they did, they should go to jail,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.” Asked whether he will direct his attorney general or FBI director to go after the committee members, Trump said, “No, not at all. I think that they’ll have to look at that.” that senior Biden White House aides, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington, DC, are discussing potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for people who might be targeted for prosecution by after he retakes power. Trump, who has previously said he would appoint a special counsel to prosecute President Joe Biden, was asked by Welker whether he still plans to go after his former political rival. “No, I’m not doing that,” Trump responded. “Unless I find something that I think is reasonable. But that’s not going to be my decision; that is going to be Pam Bondi’s decision, and to a different extent, Kash Patel,” referring to his picks for and , respectively. President-elect Donald Trump in an interview airing Sunday said he would work with Democrats on a plan to “do something about” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. Asked by NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” whether so-called Dreamers have to be worried about being deported in Trump’s second administration, the president-elect said: “The Dreamers are going to come later, and we have to do something about Dreamers.” Asked to clarify, Trump said, “I will work with the Democrats on a plan, and if we can come up with a plan, but the Democrats have made it very very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the Dreamers,” adding that Dreamers “in many cases they become successful, they have great jobs.” Welker asked if Trump wants Dreamers to be able to stay, to which Trump replied, “I do.” Early discussions among Trump’s team have focused on removing undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, A key issue under consideration is how, when and if to deport immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, commonly known as Dreamers. Targeting Dreamers would be a departure from the historically bipartisan support they’ve enjoyed. Some are temporarily protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allows recipients to live and work in the US. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has some advice for the rest of his party: Don’t “freak out” every time President-elect Trump causes controversy. “If you really, really want to freak out, that’s your prerogative. … For me, personally, I’m going to be picking my battles,” Fetterman told CNN’s Manu Raju on Thursday. “Sometimes we want to push back against core values or other things, but if everything’s a freak-out, then people can just tune you out,” he continued. The Pennsylvania Democrat also said that he is holding back on taking positions on Trump’s picks for top roles, at least until Senate Republicans unite around backing them. “I don’t have a concern on any of them, certainly not until the Republicans get all the votes lined up. We all know that, that until they have at least 50 votes, you know they’re not going to bring them to the floor.” He continued, “There’s plenty of other people that want to just, you know, clutch the pearls on other things, but that’s the rules. Like, you win, you get to pick your nominees.” Asked why he believes Trump was able to perform well in Pennsylvania this cycle, Fetterman cited Trump’s “very special connection” with voters there, noting the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. “They literally tried to kill this man, and he responded, and he yelled, ‘Fight, fight, fight.’ And that created … a lot of momentum.” US President-elect Donald Trump took to social media early Sunday morning to weigh in on the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. “Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place,” he said, adding “They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine.” “Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,” Trump said. The president-elect then highlighted the number of soldiers killed on both sides in Russia’s war on Ukraine and called for an end to the fighting. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin,” he wrote without specifying which conflict he was referring to. Russia has been waging war in Ukraine for over two years, leaving it with less military might to cover Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Syria. For Russia, Syria’s fall means losing its closest Middle Eastern ally and undermining its ability to project power while it fights its war in Ukraine. Elon Musk has long been known for his competitive spirit — and for his list of rivals. He challenged Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight. He called Amazon and Blue Origin boss Jeff Bezos a “copycat.” And just recently, he sued OpenAI’s Sam Altman. Until now, these were business and personal rivalries between some of the richest and most successful people in the world. But with Musk’s new influence in the incoming Trump administration and position as “first buddy,” some fear he could use the power of the government to benefit his own companies and harm his rivals. That could come in the form of starting or dropping government investigations, creating or weakening regulations, and awarding government contracts to the benefit of Musk’s companies. “The federal government has a set of tools in its toolbox, and the question is, will the use of those tools be governed by objective standards, through regulation and laws and the normal process of government intervention in the economy, or will it be subject to the material impulses of either the president or Elon Musk?” said one expert in law and technology who asked to speak anonymously to avoid Musk’s ire. “If all it takes is for (Musk) to say, ‘Hey, DOJ should investigate them,’ that will cause a lot of headaches.” Representatives for Musk did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. President-Elect Donald Trump unveiled a new line of fragrances under the brand name “Trump Perfumes & Colognes” in a post Saturday on Truth Social. The collection, named “Fight, Fight, Fight,” is designed to embody the spirit of victory and is also what Trump yelled after being shot this summer. “I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING,” Trump . The new fragrance line is being marketed as the ideal holiday gift and is available for purchase at gettrumpfragrances.com. The collection includes cologne for men and perfume for women, each priced at $199. Notably, the “Victory” line has already sold out on the website. “Here are my new Trump Perfumes & Colognes! I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family. Go to . Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!” President-elect Donald Trump weighed in Saturday on the in Syria, where opposition forces have reportedly seized control of several cities and are advancing on Damascus. : “THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!” Trump also argued that if Syrian rebels are able to force out President Bashar al-Assad, “it may actually be the best thing that can happen” to Russia, which he argued is too preoccupied with the war with Ukraine to stop the rebel fighters. The president-elect also blamed the Obama administration for failing to enforce the 2013 “red line” that stated that Syria’s use of chemical weapons would mean US military action. Reiterating his “America First” stance, Trump argued that Syria is not the US’ fight. “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend,” he wrote, urging a hands-off approach. While in office, Trump of a military strike in 2017 on a Syrian government airbase in response to a that killed dozens of civilians. He ordered 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the airbase that was home to the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks in what was the first direct military action taken by the US against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s . His decision at the time marked a dramatic shift in his position on whether the US should take military action against the Syrian president’s regime — which Trump opposed during his first campaign for president. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a “good and productive trilateral meeting” with US President-elect Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace on Saturday. “We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way,” Zelensky said in a post on X, adding that the three countries have agreed to continue working together. Zelensky also said of the president-elect: “President Trump is, as always, resolute.” Trump and Zelensky were originally set to hold separate consecutive talks with Macron. Zelensky that he wants to work “directly” with Trump and that he is open to his ideas, highlighting Kyiv’s eagerness to keep its most important ally onside as Russia intensifies its attacks. The United States is the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine in the country’s fight against Russia. Trump on continued US aid to Kyiv and has repeatedly claimed the war would not have started if he had been president. In July, he said he could settle the war in one day, without saying how he would do so. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

From the 2014-2023 seasons, four teams went to the playoffs. The field expanded to 12 for the 2024 season CNN anchor and chief White House correspondent Kaitlin Collins bleeds Alabama crimson, so it was only natural to check in on her after her Tide was left out of the 12-team playoff field. Her reaction was simple. “Who wants to watch some basketball?” The Alabama men’s college basketball team is ranked No. 10 in the Associated Press’ college basketball poll this week and is off to a strong 7-2 start on the season. Some consolation for Collins and the Crimson Tide fans who will have to cope with a high-profile bowl game instead of a playoff berth. It’s only the third time that Bama has watched the playoff from home since the playoff system was adopted in 2014. The College Football Playoff selection committee has revealed the final Top 25 rankings of the season. 1: Oregon 2: Georgia 3: Texas 4: Penn State 5: Notre Dame 6: Ohio State 7: Tennessee 8: Indiana 9: Boise State 10: SMU 11: Alabama 12: Arizona State 13: Miami 14: Mississippi 15: South Carolina 16: Clemson 17: BYU 18: Iowa State 19: Missouri 20: Illinois 21: Syracuse 22: Army 23: Colorado 24: UNLV 25: Memphis SMU’s head coach Rhett Lashlee spoke with ESPN and described the suspense he felt in the moments leading up to the reveal of the CFP bracket. “Until we saw SMU up there, you’re just hanging on the edge,” Lashlee said. “Just really, really happy. Thankful to the committee for rewarding our guys for their total body of work, for their consistency of performance, how they played throughout the year.” The third-year Mustangs coach also described the relief that hit once he learned that his team’s quest for a national championship hadn’t ended after an agonizing loss to Clemson in the ACC Championship game Saturday night. “When the announcement happened, honestly I got emotional just because I’m so happy for our kids,” Lashlee told ESPN. “I just think America saw SMU belongs, we’re a team that has a chance to compete for this championship and to some degree I think we’re a little bit ‘America’s team’ after last night.” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said he isn’t worried about the “rat poison” of being the only undefeated team in the College Football Playoff because he “knows how much better we can get.” “I was at the game last night and I know how much better we can get,” he told ESPN, referring to Oregon’s 45-37 win over Penn State in the Big Ten championship game. “We didn’t play our best game but we had each other’s back … I know our team knows we can get better than we were and it’s going to take our best down the stretch with the teams we get to play,” he added. As the No. 1 ranked team in the bracket, Oregon will enjoy a first-round bye and play either No. 8 Ohio State or No. 9 Tennessee in a tough quarterfinal draw. “Winning a national championship isn’t supposed to be easy … so if our path is a little bit tougher kudos to us if we go through it and take care of business,” Lanning said. Since Oregon doesn’t yet know their next opponent, Lanning added that their preparation would focus on finding “potential issues for us down the road” that would remain the same for any opponent. Any run deep into the postseason will depend on star quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who has proven to be a threat with his legs as well as his passing game. “He’s a savvy quarterback and he really understands his ability and his teammates’ ability,” Lanning said. “We love that we can put the trust in him to win it with his legs when necessary.” Only one team in the playoffs has a chance of joining the coveted group of undefeated national champions – the No. 1 ranked Oregon Ducks. In their first year in the Big Ten, the Ducks can say they came, they saw, and they conquered with a 13-0 record and a Big Ten title to match. The Ducks defeated Big Ten rivals Penn State on Saturday to win the championship and hand the Nittany Lions their second defeat of the season. Oregon star quarterback Dillon Gabriel has been key to marshaling the Ducks to the playoffs. In his first year in Eugene, Gabriel was named the Big Ten Most Valuable Player and the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, and it’s easy to see why. The Heisman Trophy candidate has thrown for 3,558 yards and 28 touchdowns during his impressive campaign and is equally as proficient when rushing. The 23-year-old has added seven touchdowns on the ground heading into the playoffs. Playing in his sixth college football season, Gabriel’s experience will be key if the Ducks are to progress far into the playoffs. The first-ever game in the 12-team CFP era will feature a pair of teams from the Hoosier State. Notre Dame will host Indiana in South Bend on Friday, December 20, at 8:00 p.m. ET on ESPN. Saturday, December 21, will feature a triple header of first round matchups, starting with a noon ET kickoff between SMU and Penn State from State College, Pennsylvania, on TNT/Max. Texas will host Clemson in Austin on that Saturday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. ET on TNT/Max, followed by a nightcap at 8:00 p.m. ET on ESPN as Tennessee heads north to face Ohio State in the Horseshoe in Columbus. The winners will advance to the quarterfinals, which will be played on December 31 and January 1. The SMU Mustangs were picked as the final CFP at-large bid over the Alabama Crimson Tide. CFP selection committee chair, Warde Manuel, explained why on ESPN. “We looked at the number of wins that Alabama had against ranked opponents. We looked at SMU’s schedule and they were undefeated in conference. Their losses were to ranked teams but we also looked at Alabama’s loss to unranked teams,” Manuel said. “We value strength of schedule. That’s why Alabama is a three-loss team is ranked ahead of other teams that have two losses. … But in the balance of it, in the way SMU played in that game, losing on the last second field goal, great win by Clemson, a great game. “We just felt that in this particular case, SMU still had the nod at 10 above Alabama, but it’s no disrespect to Alabama’s strength of schedule.” Nick Saban, widely regarded as one of football’s greatest coaches and currently a college football analyst for ESPN, says he is “hopeful that we learn from this first time around” after the inaugural 12-team college football playoff brackets were revealed. Saban, a seven-time national champion as a coach, highlighted the fifth seed – Texas – has a kinder path to the championship game than the top-four ranked teams that earned byes. “I think there are a lot of learning opportunities for us,” he told ESPN’s CFP Selection Day show. “The whole criteria for how we pick teams relative to strength of schedule … but the look at the path based on who gets a first-round bye and what is your path to get to the championship game. “In every other tournament venue, the top four teams end up getting the top four positions to get a bye and because of what they earn throughout the course of the year – relative to their schedule, who they beat and how they’re ranked – they would have the best opportunity to get to the championship game.” “And as we pointed out already, that’s not necessarily true; the fifth seed has the best chance to get to the championship from a path standpoint. Saban added that the No. 5 seed for Texas “doesn’t mean they’re going to get there,” but that they will have to play “the lowest-ranked teams” to get to the championship game. “And some of the higher seeds – like Oregon – is going to have to play Ohio State or Tennessee, which are the eighth or ninth ranked teams in this playoff system, but some of the best teams in college football. I think we can learn from that as well.” After weeks of speculation, the first-ever 12-team College Football Playoff is set. Of the teams on the bubble, SMU sneaked in at the last minute as the No. 11 seed, meaning that Alabama misses out. Big Ten winner Oregon is the No. 1 seed after a 13-0 season. Georgia, the SEC champion, is the No. 2 seed, Mountain West champion Boise State is the No. 3 seed, and Big 12 champion Arizona State is the No. 4 seed. They will all receive a first-round bye and take to the field in the quarterfinals. In the first round, No. 5 seed Texas will host No. 12 Clemson. The Tigers made the playoffs after winning the ACC championship game on Saturday. No. 8 Ohio State will host No. 9 Tennessee while No. 6 Penn State will welcome No. 11 SMU. No. 7 Notre Dame will face in-state rival No. 10 Indiana for a place in the quarterfinal. THE BRACKET IS SET ✍️ Who are you taking to win the ? Alabama and Miami are the first two teams out of the 12-team College Football Playoff. The Crimson Tide finished the regular season at 9-3. Alabama was 3-1 against last week’s Top 25 but came up short to two teams that each lost six games this season – Vanderbilt and Oklahoma The Hurricanes were 10-2, losing two of its last three games to unranked teams on the road – Georgia Tech and Syracuse. The SMU Mustangs were not be watching Sunday’s CFB bracket reveal as a team, ESPN reported. After a heart-breaking loss to Clemson the Mustangs didn’t make it back to campus until 4:30 a.m. CT, according to ESPN’s Quint Kessenich. SMU coach Rhett Lashlee sent the team their separate ways and the players will sweat their way through the bracket reveal show from the privacy’s of their homes. Book it. The decision not to watch the reveal as a team was made in part because of SMU’s bubble status. In 2023, undefeated Florida State was left out of the four-team CFP field and images of the disappointed Seminoles team became instant memes. “The negative social media images of the Florida State watch party kind of scaring these teams away from doing that,” Kessenich reported. “So they’ll control all the images as the players watch this show from their various homes.” SMU did not suffer the same fate as the Seminoles, getting into the playoff as the 11 seed and earning the right to play at Penn State in the first round. Many pundits argued that a three-loss Alabama team was more deserving of a spot in the CFP field than a two-loss SMU squad, but in the end, the CFP selection committee rewarded the upstart Mustangs over the blue-blood Crimson Tide. The Mustangs are coming off their second-straight season with at least 10 regular season wins under third-year coach Rhett Lashlee. Projected to finish in the middle of the ACC pack in the preseason, SMU bullied their way to a perfect 8-0 record in the ACC and an 11-1 record overall in regular season play, rising from being unranked to a top-ten team by season’s end. After a heartbreaking last-second loss to Clemson in the ACC title game Saturday night, the Mustangs saw their playoff lives flash before their eyes. However, the team can now breathe a sigh of relief and look ahead to a first round matchup against Penn State. Texas, the SEC championship runner-up, earns the No. 5 seed while Penn State, who lost to Oregon in the Big Ten title game, gets the No. 6 seed. Both teams will enjoy the consolation of hosting a CFP first round game in their home stadiums. Both the Longhorns and Nittany Lions finished the season at 11-2. No. 7 seed Notre Dame and No. 8 seed Ohio State have both earned home games in the first round of the CFP. Notre Dame will host in-state rival No. 10 Indiana, while Ohio State will face No. 9 seed Tennessee. A 34-31 loss to Clemson in the ACC Championship game took the SMU Mustangs from dreams of a first round bye to sweating over whether they will get a CFP invite at all. Entering the game at No. 8 in the CFP rankings, SMU’s disappointing loss may be enough to drop the Mustangs out of the 12-team bracket in the eyes of the selection committee. Projected to finish in the middle of the ACC pack in the preseason, the Mustangs bullied their way to a perfect 8-0 record in the ACC and an 11-1 record overall in regular season play, rising from being unranked to a top ten team by season’s end. But the ACC is widely seen as being a weaker conference than the Big Ten or the SEC, and many experts expect SMU’s stumble to drop the team below a three-loss Alabama squad from the SEC. Despite producing 15 of the past 18 national champions, the deference being shown to the Big Ten and SEC conferences didn’t sit well with SMU’s third-year head coach Rhett Lashlee when he spoke on the subject earlier in the season. “When other leagues beat each other up internally, they’re considered a deep, solid league, but when we beat up internally, we’re considered a weak league,” Lashlee said of the perception of the ACC. “I just want our league to get the same respect that everyone else gets.” The Mustangs are seeking some long-awaited redemption. In 1987, SMU became the first – and to this day, only – football program to receive the “death penalty” after a widespread scheme was discovered where players were being paid to come to the school. The NCAA canceled SMU’s 1987 season, and the Mustangs didn’t play another football game until 1989. Boise State has been named the No. 3 seed after it won the Mountain West championship game on Friday while Arizona State – the Big 12 champion – is the No. 4 seed. Both teams will also receive a first-round bye. Oregon and Georgia are the top two seeds and will receive a first-round bye. No. 1 Oregon has produced a 13-0 season and won the Big Ten championship game on Saturday while No. 2 Georgia took down Texas in a classic SEC championship game on Saturday. The fate of some teams will come down to the wire. Alabama was ranked No. 11 in the committee’s , scraping into the playoff spots ahead of Miami after the Hurricanes shocking loss to Syracuse on November 30. That result ended any hopes that No. 12 Miami, No. 13 Ole Miss and No. 14 South Carolina might have had of making the playoffs. Alabama, though, still has a shot at making the CFP. SMU will be watching with bated breath as well. After a devastating loss to Clemson in the ACC championship, the Mustangs are counting on their conference championship game appearance to carry them into postseason play. Indiana University will also be watching closely. The Hoosiers finished the season with just one loss and were ranked No. 9 in the penultimate CFP rankings. But, Indiana is fighting against a softer strength of schedule and a lesser historical reputation than many of the blue bloods who could be left on the outside looking in. The Hoosiers believe they’ve done enough to earn a playoff berth, but tension will be high in Bloomington. After 15 weeks of thrilling action and shocking upsets, the (CFP) is just about here. And it comes with added anticipation this year as, for the first time ever, 12 teams will be competing for a place in the College Football Playoff Championship Game instead of four. On Sunday, a 13-person committee will release its final , determining the field for this year’s playoffs. So, ahead of the first-of-its-kind event, here is everything you need to know. Previously, the CFP ran for just two rounds with four teams involved, with an expanded field allowing more teams to compete for a national championship. In this new format, the five highest-ranked conference champions and the next seven highest-ranked teams will fill the 12 spots in the bracket. There is no limit to how many teams from one conference can qualify – and it looks as if the Big Ten and SEC will dominate the field. The final CFP rankings will not necessarily reflect the seeding of the 12 teams in the tournament. The top four conference champions will get a first round bye into the quarterfinal round. If a team is ranked in the top four but is not a conference champion, it will be seeded fifth and will play in two weeks in the first round of the playoffs. Once the seeds have been set, to a first round game on December 20 or December 21 at the home stadiums of the highest seeds. The four highest-ranked conference champions will likely be Boise State, Georgia, Oregon and Arizona State, who all won this weekend in their conference championship games and will each receive a first-round bye. Boise State guaranteed its spot in the playoffs by winning a second consecutive Mountain West Conference title on Friday, defeating No. 19 UNLV 21-7 behind yet another outstanding performance from running back Ashton Jeanty. The junior is likely to be in New York next week as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, the award for college football’s best player. He has already produced one of the and added 209 yards on to take his season total to 2,497, within touching distance of the all-time FBS record. While Boise State is not from one of the traditional football powerhouse conferences — the Southeastern (SEC), Big Ten, Big 12 and Atlantic Coast conferences – it will likely be ranked ahead of ACC champion Clemson, thus earning a first-round bye. Georgia took down Texas in overtime in a classic SEC championship game, likely earning a first-round bye and relegating the Longhorns to playing a home game in two weeks. Oregon did what was expected and beat Penn State in the Big Ten Championship Game, continuing their unbeaten season. The unlikely team getting a first round bye is the Arizona State University Sun Devils. They were largely expected to finish last in their first season in the Big 12 but instead won the conference championship and will potentially be ranked ahead of Clemson, which won the ACC championship game but has three losses. Georgia’s win over Texas means they can rest up and wait to play on either New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in the semifinals. The Longhorns will now have to play in the first round. Arizona State’s win in the Big 12 championship game over Iowa State has sent the Cyclones home for the season. With three losses coming into the game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, they needed a win over the Sun Devils to sneak into the final field of 12. The result that shook up the field the most was Clemson University’s thrilling win over SMU in the ACC championship game. The Tigers guaranteed themselves a spot in the field of 12 with a walk-off field goal as time expired, having just given up a 17-point lead to the Mustangs. But a vital kickoff return put Clemson in position and a clutch 56-yard kick sent them to the postseason. The result means SMU — who finished the regular season ranked No. 8 in the CFP rankings — now hopes it will not be penalized for playing in and losing its conference championship game while a team like Alabama sat at home watching. The impending decision on whether to punish a team for losing its conference championship game sets up the first big test for the selection committee in the 12-team format. © 2024 Cable News Network.
